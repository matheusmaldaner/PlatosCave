Abstract
China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift
in patterns of world trade. Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the
received empirical wisdom about how labor markets adjust to trade shocks.
Alongside the heralded consumer beneﬁts of expanded trade are substan-
tial adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are
most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to
foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local labor markets
is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remain-
ing depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a
full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers ex-
perience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national
level, employment has fallen in the US industries more exposed to import
competition, as expected, but offsetting employment gains in other indus-
tries have yet to materialize. Better understanding when and where trade is
costly, and how and why it may be beneﬁcial, is a key item on the research
agenda for trade and labor economists.

1. INTRODUCTION
Mainstream economists have long argued that international trade improves welfare. Although
trade may redistribute income, theory assures us that under standard conditions the gains to
winners are more than sufﬁcient to offset any losses incurred by those suffering adverse effects
from foreign competition. Belief in the Pareto-improving nature of trade made economists front-
line advocates for the broad-based liberalization of commerce that was embedded in the General
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and other institutions built to manage the global econ-
omy after World War II (Bhagwati 1989). Paul Krugman states this view vividly in his 1997 Journal
of Economic Literature article: “If economists ruled the world, there would be no need for a World
Trade Organization (WTO). The economist’s case for free trade is essentially a unilateral case: a
country serves its own interests by pursuing free trade regardless of what other countries may do”
(Krugman 1997, p. 113).
Of course, introductory trade theory also teaches us that international trade is not generally
Pareto improving. In their undergraduate textbook, Krugman & Obstfeld (2008, p. 64) write,
“Owners of a country’s abundant factors gain from trade, but owners of a country’s scarce factors
lose. . . [C]ompared with the rest of the world the United States is abundantly endowed with highly
skilled labor and (. . .) low-skilled labor is correspondingly scarce. This means that international
trade tends to make low-skilled workers in the United States worse off—not just temporarily, but on
a sustained basis.” For the ﬁrst three or four decades of the Bretton Woods era, however, there was
little occasion to scrutinize the beneﬁts of trade. Most goods ﬂows were North–North—between
nations with relatively similar average incomes—which helped subdue distributional impacts.
Views on how trade affects wages and employment turned less sanguine in the 1990s. As wage
inequality rose, low-skill wages and employment fell, and manufacturing employment contracted
in the United States, globalization was seen initially as a prime suspect. After vigorous inquiry,
concern about the labor-market consequences of trade receded. Economists did not ﬁnd trade
to have had substantial adverse distributional effects in developed economies, either for low-skill
workers speciﬁcally or for import-competing factors and sectors more generally.1 The broad
sentiment that emerged in the literature was that labor-market developments were primarily
attributable to technological changes that complemented high-skill workers and reduced labor
demand in manufacturing. The impact of international trade on these outcomes seemed to be
modest, at best.
Several pieces of evidence favored these conclusions. First, the share of US employment in
manufacturing had been in decline since the end of World War II, peaking at 39.0% of US
nonfarm employment in January of 1944 and then falling decade after decade to a low of 8.6%
in June 2015 (Figure 1). The disappearance of manufacturing jobs was nothing new. Second,
the steep rise in wage inequality and fall in real wages of low-education workers in the United
States and many other developed countries did not coincide closely with rising trade openness. As
Feenstra (1998) and Leamer (2000) note, the ratio of merchandise trade to GDP in the developed
world rose steeply during the 1970s but stabilized thereafter, which greatly weakened the case for
trade, having caused rising wage inequality and falling low-skill wages during the 1980s and early
1990s.
Third, contrary to the predictions of textbook trade models, manufacturing industries in de-
veloped countries appeared to be substituting toward high-skill workers despite rising skill prices,
suggesting that these industries were experiencing a skill-biased demand shift that emanated
1For formal surveys of the literature on trade and wages, see Feenstra & Hanson (2003) and Harrison et al. (2011). In
developing economies, the labor-market impacts of globalization have been more diffuse (Goldberg & Pavcnik 2007).

logically from the adoption of new technology (Berman et al. 1998). Although trade in the form
of offshoring may produce such demand shifts, its modest scale in the 1980s and early 1990s
meant that its estimated impacts were far smaller than those of investments in high-tech capital
and equipment (Feenstra & Hanson 1999).2 Finally, simple factor-content calibration exercises—
which rescaled traded-good imports into embodied labor imports—found that rising trade inte-
gration could account for only a small part of the fall in relative wages of low-skill workers in the
United States (Borjas et al. 1997, Krugman 2000).3 When Richard Freeman asked in 1995 if US
wages were “being set in Beijing,” his answer was an emphatic no (Freeman 1995).
The trade and wages debate reached something of a coda around the year 2000. The following
is a reasonable summary of the contemporaneous consensus:
1. Trade had not in recent decades been a major contributor to declining manufacturing em-
ployment or rising wage inequality in developed countries;
2A further development, seen initially as damning for trade-based explanations of changes in labor-market outcomes, was
the simultaneous rise in wage inequality in developed and developing economies (Berman et al. 1998). We now know that
in the presence of offshoring (Feenstra & Hanson 1997, Grossman & Rossi-Hansberg 2008) or heterogeneous ﬁrms and
skill-technology complementarity (Burstein & Vogel 2012, Sampson 2014), greater economic integration between countries
may cause wage inequality to rise worldwide.
3The usefulness of factor-content calculations for predicting labor-market outcomes was the subject of a spirited debate in
the 1990s (Krugman 2000, Leamer 2000). This debate has since been largely resolved by the discovery that a tight (although
structurally model-speciﬁc) relationship between the factor content of trade and relative factor prices holds for a wide class
of trade theories (Burstein & Vogel 2011).

2. Workers employed in regions specializing in import-competing sectors could readily real-
locate to other regions if displaced by trade; and
3. Due to the law of one price for skill, any labor-market impacts of trade would be felt by
low-skill workers generally, not by trade-exposed workers speciﬁcally.
A corollary of these observations is that trade should affect prevailing wage levels nationally but
not employment rates locally or regionally. Moreover, given the presumed ﬂuidity of US labor
markets, even in the short- or medium run, the aggregate gains from trade in the United States
should be positive.4
Just as the economics profession was reaching consensus on the consequences of trade for wages
and employment, an epochal shift in patterns of world trade was gaining momentum. China, for
centuries an economic laggard, was ﬁnally emerging as a great power and toppling established
patterns of trade accordingly. The advance of China, as we argue below, has also toppled much
of the received empirical wisdom about the impact of trade on labor markets. The consensus that
trade could be strongly redistributive in theory but was relatively benign in practice has not stood
up well to these new developments. Nor has the belief that trade adjustment is relatively friction-
less, with impacts that diffuse over large skill categories rather than being concentrated among
groups of workers in trade-competing industries or locations. In quantifying these impacts and
adjustment frictions, recent evidence further suggests that the short- and medium-run adjustment
costs demanded by large trade shocks are sizable entries in the accounting of gains from trade.
China’s rise has provided a rare opportunity for studying the impact of a large trade shock
on labor markets in developed economies. An emerging literature on this topic offers a wealth of
evidence and surprises that should catalyze and discipline research for many years to come. We
believe that this evidence calls into question the consensus of the early 2000s and makes clear that,
after the early Bretton Woods era aberration, the distributional consequences of trade are alive
and well. Although these results do not at all suggest that international trade is in the aggregate
harmful to nations—indeed, China’s unprecedented rise from widespread poverty bears testimony
to trade’s transformative economic power—they make clear that trade not only has beneﬁts but
also signiﬁcant costs. These include distributional costs, which theory has long recognized, and
adjustment costs, which the literature has tended to downplay. Better understanding when and
where trade is costly, and how and why it may be beneﬁcial, is a key item on the research agenda
for trade and labor economists. Developing effective tools for managing and mitigating the costs
of trade adjustment should be high on the agenda for policymakers and applied economists.
This review discusses ﬁndings from the rapidly growing literature on China’s rise that have
enriched our understanding of the impact of trade shocks on developed countries. We begin by
discussing why China’s long-awaited reemergence is helpful for studying the impacts of trade
on labor-market outcomes. We then offer a simple theoretical framework that guides inquiry
on measuring and interpreting these impacts. Next, we present evidence on how trade shocks
originating in China have affected industries and plants, local labor markets housing those plants,
and individual workers employed (or formerly employed) in those industries and local markets.
We suggest how these results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from
trade. Finally, we argue that having failed to anticipate how signiﬁcant the dislocations from trade
might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade,

Advisors (2015).

such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of
evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.
2. CHINA’S RISE
On June 23, 1989, the Wall Street Journal marked the publication of its centennial edition by
predicting what the global economy would look like 25 years hence. It selected the countries that
it thought would be growth leaders and those it saw as future growth laggards. On the former list
were Bangladesh, Thailand, and Zimbabwe. On the latter list was China, which, as the newspaper
prognosticated, would fail to shake off “the stultifying bureaucracy of hard-line communism”
(Anders 2014).
The Wall Street Journal’s predictions reveal just how uncertain China’s future appeared in
the late 1980s. After a decade of “reform and opening” under Deng Xiaoping, hardliners had
reestablished control over economic policy. Their resurgence, fueled on the economic side by
rising inﬂation and on the political side by the events at Tiananmen Square, caused reform to stall
and cast doubt on China’s market transition (Naughton 2007). Seen in this context, skepticism
about China’s future, although far off the mark from today’s vantage point, would then have been
entirely warranted.
China’s one-quarter century of dizzying export growth began once the reformist camp reaf-
ﬁrmed its authority over economic policy in the early 1990s. Deng, in one of the ﬁnal political
gambits of his career, launched his famous “southern tour” in 1992 to focus national attention on
the successes of earlier policy experiments in a handful of locations on China’s east coast (Vogel
2011). These efforts had included the creation of special economic zones (SEZs), which allowed
foreign companies to set up factories that imported inputs and exported ﬁnal outputs, relatively
free from the interference of government minders (Yu & Tian 2012, Alder et al. 2013). As reform-
ers retook the helm, China embraced global markets more fully, pushing the number of SEZs from
20 in 1991 to 150 in 2010. According to the World Bank, inﬂows of foreign direct investment,
which had averaged only 0.7% of GDP during the 1980s, surged to 4.2% of GDP during the
1990s and 2000s. Production for foreign markets began a spectacular ascent, with China’s share
of world manufacturing exports growing from 2.3% in 1991 to 18.8% in 2013 (Figure 2; see also
Storesletten & Zilibotti 2014 on the factors that have shaped China’s development process).
To provide context for China’s reintegration into the world economy, we highlight key aspects
of its recent performance that inform the analysis of attendant labor-market outcomes in developed
countries. One is the idiosyncratic nature of China’s transition from central planning to market
orientation. The momentum of this transition—which has propelled China’s trade—owes much
more to dismal conditions in China at the time of Mao’s death than to China’s subsequent responses
to contemporaneous shocks in high-income economies. Also important is the nature of China’s
postreform manufacturing surge. When and how China became “the global factory” are important
for deﬁning the scope and intensity of the China trade shock. Finally, there is the structure of
global trade balances. China’s penchant for running large current account surpluses has shaped
the temporal distribution of trade gains and losses arising from its growth.
2.1. Making Use of Trade Shocks
The interest of trade economists in China is driven both by its large quantitative importance as
an exporter of manufactured goods and by the paucity of natural experiments in international
trade. Among the most challenging issues for empirical analysis is that changes in trade policy in
one country are often dictated by changes in the behavior of its trading partners. Consider the

North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted in 1994. After investing heavily in Mexico in
the 1980s and early 1990s, multinational companies lobbied hard for the US Congress to approve
the pact (Mills 1993). The treaty’s passage, which contributed to a further expansion in foreign
direct investment, was arguably induced at least in part by the earlier foreign direct investment.
In the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) case, as in similar episodes of economic
opening, identifying trade’s impact on labor markets is complicated by the joint determination
of trade barriers and trade and investment ﬂows (see McLaren & Hakobyan 2016 on the local
labor-market effects of NAFTA in the United States).
Three features of China’s experience help to overcome these challenges in identifying the
causal effects of trade shocks. The ﬁrst is the unexpected nature of China’s export growth, which
caught many observers—including those at the Wall Street Journal—by surprise. Even after the
launching of reform in the 1980s, few anticipated how important China would become for the
world economy. Between 1984 and 1990, China’s share of world manufacturing exports ticked up
only modestly, from 1.2% to 1.9%. Its trade expansion did not begin in earnest until the 1990s,
15 years after Mao’s death. China’s post-Tiananmen crackdown made it difﬁcult to foresee the
conﬂuence of events that would allow it to unleash its potential. After all, the Chinese economy
had underperformed relative to Western Europe during every epoch since the 1500s (Zhu 2012).
Second is the degree of China’s isolation under Mao, which created abundant opportunities
for later catch up (Zhu 2012, Brandt et al. 2014). The distortions of the Maoist era kept China far
inside its production frontier. Between 1952 and 1978—from three years after the Communist
Party’s rise to power until Deng’s rehabilitation following Mao’s death—China’s GDP per capita
sank from 59th in the world to 134th out of 167 Penn World Table countries.5 By 1991, China’s
income ranking had nudged up modestly from 134th to 126th in the world. Convergence did not
begin in earnest until the rapid globalization of the ensuing two decades. By 2001, China’s income
ranking had risen to 101st and by 2011 it had reached 77th. Once China’s economy took off, it

ignited a phase of transitional growth that was governed largely by the country’s accumulated
productivity gap with the developed world (Song et al. 2011).6
A ﬁnal key feature of China’s rise—which we explore in more detail below—is its distinctive
comparative advantage. Manufacturing is at the heart of the country’s economic turnaround.
Between 1991 and 2012, China’s share of world manufacturing value added increased by a factor
of six, from 4.1% to 24.0% (Figure 2). Whereas many large emerging economies specialize
in primary commodities—Brazil in iron ore, Indonesia in rubber, and Russia in oil and gas—
China’s advantage is overwhelmingly in industrial goods. Over the period 1990 to 2013, the
manufacturing sector averaged 88% of China’s merchandise exports, compared to 50% for Brazil,
46% for Indonesia, and 20% for Russia.7 This trade concentration means that China’s growth
has represented a large positive net global supply shock for manufacturing and a large positive net
global demand shock for raw materials. The impacts of China’s rise are consequently likely to vary
across regional and national economies according to their initial patterns of industry specialization.
2.2. The Global Factory
China’s manufacturing performance reﬂects a comparative advantage in the sector that remained
latent during the Maoist era. Today, China’s net exports in manufacturing are strongly positive
and its net exports of raw materials are strongly negative (Figure 3a). Its true strength in the sector
emerged only in the 1990s. Figure 3b plots revealed comparative advantage (RCA: a country’s
share of global exports in an industry divided by its share of aggregate global exports) for China
in two broad sectors, manufacturing and primary commodities, where the latter group comprises
foods, fuels, ores and metals.8 It was not until 1992 that China moved from disadvantage to
advantage in manufacturing, as indicated by positive log RCA values, and from advantage to
disadvantage in primary commodities, as indicated by negative log RCA values. The strength of
China in manufacturing surely reﬂects its abundant supply of labor relative to the rest of the
world (Amiti & Freund 2010). The massive increase in China’s industrial labor force—resulting
from the decollectivization of agriculture, the closing of inefﬁcient state-owned enterprises, and
the migration of 250 million workers from farms to cities—has made China the default location
for all types of labor-intensive production (Li et al. 2012). However, factor abundance cannot
be the whole story behind the country’s specialization. Its advantage is far from uniform across
labor-intensive industries (Autor et al. 2014). Figure 4 plots the change in net import penetration
from China between 1991 and 2007 against the share of production workers in total employment
in 1991 for 397 four-digit US manufacturing industries.9 We group industries into 10 sectoral
aggregates, which share a common marker in the ﬁgure. That few points in Figure 4 show a
6This period of transitional growth will of course come to an end ultimately and indeed may have ended already (see
Eichengreen et al. 2013 for a discussion).
7Over time, China has become even more specialized in manufacturing. Between 1990 and 2007, the share of manufacturing
in China’s merchandise exports rose from 72% to 93%, a level at which it has since stabilized.
8The denominator in China’s RCA index is the country’s share of world merchandise exports. Following World Bank deﬁni-
tions, manufacturing includes Standard International Trade Classiﬁcation (SITC) sectors 5 (chemicals), 6 (basic manufactures
except for division 68), 7 (machinery and transport equipment), and 8 (miscellaneous manufactured goods). Food, fuels, ores
and metals include SITC sectors 0 (food and live animals), 1 (beverages and tobacco), 2 (crude materials), 3 (mineral fuels),
and 4 (animal and vegetable oils and fats), and division 68 (nonferrous metals).
9The change in import penetration is the 1991 to 2007 change in US imports from China divided by 1991 US domestic
absorption (shipments plus imports minus exports); it is Winsorized at −20 and 100 in the ﬁgure. The employment share of
production workers uses 1991 values from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database.

negative change in net import penetration over the period reveals how US imports from China
grew by more than exports—often substantially by more—in nearly every industry.
The dominant pattern in Figure 4 is that industries within a sector tend to occupy a relatively

women’s nonathletic footwear, waterproof outerwear), the increase in penetration approaches or
even exceeds 100%, which indicates that the 1991 to 2007 growth in imports from China is nearly
equal to or greater than initial domestic spending on goods produced by the industry. Other
industries in the sector (e.g., coated fabrics, automotive and apparel trimmings) show near-zero
increase in import penetration. Similar patterns of dispersion hold for sectors with comparably
high labor intensity, such as furniture and wood products (average initial production worker share
of 0.82) and toys and miscellaneous products (average initial production worker share of 0.72).11
The cross-industry variation in Chinese export growth evident in Figure 4 is far from un-
usual. The distribution of comparative advantage across industries for a country tends to be fat-
tailed, such that for most countries relatively few products dominate exports (Hanson et al. 2015).
Because of this skewness, US industries—and the regions in which they locate—vary widely in
their exposure to import competition from China. As we discuss in Section 4, this variation is
useful for identifying the labor-market consequences of trade shocks.
China’s export surge in manufacturing accelerated after 2001, the year in which the country
entered the WTO (Figure 2). On ﬁrst consideration, one wonders why WTO accession mattered
much for China’s trade. Europe and the United States had granted China most-favored nation
(MFN) status as far back as the 1980s. WTO membership would seem to have done little more
than formalize trade relations that were already two decades old. Still, something happened to
deepen China’s manufacturing prowess: Between 1998 and 2007, productivity in the sector grew
at the astounding rate of 8% per year (Brandt et al. 2012). Although the literature has yet to
11An industry-level regression of the change in net import penetration between 1991 and 2007 on 10 subsector dummies has

provide a full accounting of China’s recent export growth, it has uncovered several mechanisms
through which reform strengthened its manufacturing industries.
One such mechanism is privatization. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, China idled many
state-owned manufacturing enterprises, moving toward compliance with WTO provisions that
sanction state subsidies for domestic industries. Capital and labor were then reallocated from
smaller, less productive state-owned companies to privately owned manufacturing plants, raising
productivity and output in the sector (Hsieh & Song 2015). Joining the WTO also forced China
to phase out requirements that had obligated many private establishments to export through state
intermediaries. Such restrictions constitute barriers to export, which the WTO forbids expressly.
Bai et al. (2015) estimate that had private ﬁrms not been granted direct trading rights, China’s
manufacturing exports in the 2000s would have been one-third smaller. Along with greater ease
in exporting, WTO membership gave Chinese manufacturers greater access to imported inter-
mediate inputs (Brandt & Morrow 2014), which were an added boon to productivity (Manova &
Zhang 2012). A further consequence of China’s WTO entry regards the insecurity of its earlier
MFN access to the US market. Prior to 2001, China’s MFN status in the United States was
subject to annual reauthorization by Congress. Pierce & Schott (2016) and Handley & Limao
(2014) argue that the lurking prospect of a return to non-MFN tariffs, which averaged 37.0%
in 1999 as compared to average MFN tariffs of only 3.4% in that year, dissuaded Chinese ﬁrms
from investing in exporting to the United States. WTO accession removed this uncertainty and
encouraged China–US trade.
2.3. The Global Macroeconomic Context
TheimpactofChina’srecentgrowthontheglobaleconomyisnotjustaboutthecountry’slong-run
comparative advantage. The near-term labor-market consequences of its trade expansion included
China’s trade surplus widening substantially. Figure 5 shows the current account balance as a share
of GDP for China and the United States from 1985 to 2012. China’s average current account
surplus rose from 1.7% of GDP in the 1990s to 4.8% in the 2000s. In mirror-like fashion, the
average US current account deﬁcit rose from 1.6% of GDP in the 1990s to 4.4% in the 2000s. In a
world economy with many countries, there is no reason why the trade balance for any one country
would be related systematically to that for any other country. However, because the US dollar
functions as a global reserve currency, China’s massive net capital outﬂows have been associated
with net foreign purchases of dollar-denominated assets.
In trade theory, it is standard to assume that trade is balanced and to analyze the impact of
trade shocks on the long-run global equilibrium. Why should trade imbalances matter for the
labor-market consequences of China’s growth? With balanced trade, growth in China’s exports
is matched by growth in its imports. Although the United States sees greater import competition
in some industries, it also sees expanded exports elsewhere in manufacturing and in other traded
sectors. China’s rise may cause US workers to reallocate from one traded industry to another but
it would not necessarily cause them to exit the traded sector altogether.
Trade imbalances complicate matters by introducing a temporal dimension into sectoral em-
ployment adjustment (see Crino & Epifani 2014 on how changes in trade balances affect labor-
market outcomes in a North–South trade model). Suppose that policy distortions in China—such
as the excess absorption of credit by state-owned enterprises (Song et al. 2011)—induce the coun-
try to run a trade surplus and the US to run a trade deﬁcit. Growth in China’s manufacturing
sector due to enhanced productivity arising from its market transition would cause employment
in US traded industries to contract, pushing workers either into nontraded jobs or out of work
entirely. In effect, China would be loaning the US the funds that it needs to enjoy positive net

imports today.12 As Figure 4 shows, few US industries saw an increase in net exports to China
between 1991 and 2007. At some point in the future, Chinese savings would be expected to fall
and consumption to rise, as China’s net exports turned negative and US net exports turned pos-
itive. US traded output and employment would expand, and the United States would begin to
repay China for its earlier borrowing. In this long-run scenario, China’s rising comparative ad-
vantage would generate long-run employment losses in the US traded industries in which China
enjoyed a long-run comparative advantage, whereas trade imbalances cause additional short-run
US employment losses in traded industries pushed temporarily into contraction. Why has China
become such a large net creditor to the rest of the world? The literature attributes current account
surpluses in China to government interventions that have kept national savings at artiﬁcially high
levels. One hypothesized distortion is the government’s continued support for large state-owned
enterprises.13 These companies have ﬁrst call on loans from state-run banks, leaving private busi-
nesses to ﬁnance investment out of retained earnings, thereby elevating the corporate savings rate
(Song et al. 2011). Another, and perhaps less obviously relevant, distortion is China’s one-child
policy (recently relaxed), which increased male-female birth ratios and intensiﬁed competition in
the marriage market (Wei & Zhang 2011). Those with sons could potentially increase their sav-
ings rate to ﬁnance real estate purchases as a means of improving their child’s marriage prospects.
A third distortion—advanced by think tanks and politicians in Washington, DC (see, e.g., Cline
2010)—is that China has consciously undervalued its nominal exchange rate so as to promote its
exports.14
12This logic, of course, applies to a two-country world. In a many-country world, there is no necessary connection between
bilateral trade and bilateral capital ﬂows.
13Although the private sector has grown substantially in China, state-owned companies remain an active part of the economy
(Hsieh & Song 2015), especially in banking, communications, construction, energy, and transportation.
14The popular sentiment notwithstanding, the academic literature has had little success in ﬁnding empirical support for
systematic renminbi undervaluation (Cheung et al. 2007).

3. THEORY
Much ﬁrst-generation research on trade and wages worked under the canonical version of the
Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model (e.g., Lawrence & Slaughter 1993, Borjas et al. 1997). The attrac-
tion of the HO framework, and in particular of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, for analyzing
labor-market impacts of trade is its elegant connection between industry-level shocks (manifested
as externally given changes in product prices) and national factor-market outcomes (changes in
wages). The simplicity of this mapping perhaps explains why economists relied on the model for
so long, despite its dependence on assumptions that range from the counterfactual—countries
have to remain within their initial “cone of diversiﬁcation”—to the arcane—the number of ﬁnal
goods a country produces has to equal the number of primary factors.
Frustration with HO turned out to be a boon to research on trade and labor markets. Early
approaches (Feenstra & Hanson 1997, 1999; Grossman & Rossi-Hansberg 2008) ﬂipped the
framework on its head by focusing on changes in the set of goods—or, more precisely, the set
of intermediate inputs—that a country produces. Allowing for changes in specialization patterns
creates a new adjustment margin between the production tasks a country performs at home and
the others it offshores. Recent work has wedded HO and modern trade theories that incorporate
heterogeneous ﬁrms. Burstein & Vogel (2012) embed a Melitz (2003)-style model, in which ﬁrms
differ according to their productivity, into an otherwise standard HO setting. Calibrating the
model and allowing for more productive ﬁrms to be more intensive in the use of high-skill labor
reveal that freer trade affects the wage premium for high-skill labor more through the Melitz
mechanism of within-industry shifts in employment toward more productive ﬁrms than through
the HO mechanism of between-industry shifts in labor demand. In many analyses of the impact of
productivity growth in China on global welfare, the literature dispenses with HO entirely, relying
on either a Melitz-type setting (Hsieh & Ossa 2011) or the Eaton & Kortum (2002) model of
Ricardian comparative advantage (Di Giovanni et al. 2014). Gone from current literature is the
sole concern of estimating the impact of trade on the wage gap between high-skill and low-skill
labor, which preoccupied inquiry in the 1990s. In its place is interest in a wider array of margins
through which economies adjust to trade shocks.
The sketch of a theoretical framework that we provide in this section follows the recent trend of
working with trade models that have a gravity structure (Arkolakis et al. 2015). These models do not
lend themselves easily to studying the impact of trade on earnings inequality. They do, however,
make it tractable to allow for varying degrees of labor mobility between regions or industries
(Redding 2012). The presence of frictions in worker mobility creates an abundant set of margins
along which we can observe how labor markets respond to trade shocks.15 The task of empirical
research then becomes to clarify which margins of adjustment are operational, to estimate the
magnitude of adjustment along each margin at different time horizons, and to determine how
long it takes for full adjustment to occur.
3.1. A Bare-Bones Model
To characterize the theoretical mechanisms at work, it is sufﬁcient to allow for a single labor-
market friction, which we designate as imperfect labor mobility across regions within a country.
15On adjustment to trade shocks at the ﬁrm level, see Amiti & Davis (2012) and Hummels et al. (2014); on adjustment at the
industry level, see Bernard et al. (2006), Ebenstein et al. (2014), and Bloom et al. (2016); and on adjustment to trade at the
regional level, see Borjas & Ramey (1995), Topalova (2010), Kovak (2013), and McLaren & Hakobyan (2016).

Allowing for geographic labor immobility runs counter to the belief that US regional labor markets
are integrated seamlessly. However, there is mounting evidence that the movement of labor across
US cities and states in the aftermath of changes in regional labor demand is slow and incomplete
(Blanchard & Katz 1992, Glaeser & Gyourko 2005, Yagan 2014) and that such incompleteness
is strongest among less-educated workers (Bound & Holzer 2000, Wozniak 2010, Malamud &
Wozniak 2012, Diamond 2015).16 Recent work on the impacts of trade with China (discussed in
Section 4) similarly conﬁrms the slowness of regional labor-market adjustment.
In our model sketch, we make the extreme assumption of complete geographic labor immo-
bility. In the Eaton & Kortum (2002) framework, one can relax this assumption by allowing for
worker heterogeneity in moving costs between regions (Caliendo et al. 2015) or for a Roy-type
structure with worker heterogeneity in industry productivity (Galle et al. 2015). Either setting
creates an upward sloping regional labor supply curve, whose slope may be steeper in the short- or
medium run than in the long run. Variation in regional exposure to foreign competition arises from
differences in regional industry specialization patterns. In the Eaton & Kortum framework, these
specialization patterns reﬂect exogenous regional differences in industry productivity. Empirical
work does not take a stand on the origin of industry specialization, treating it as predetermined in
some period well before the China trade shock materializes.
We begin by describing how changes in China’s export supply affect US industry product
demand and are subsequently transmitted to changes in traded sector output at the US regional
level. If trade has a gravity structure, we can write total demand by the US aggregate economy for
traded output produced in US region i as
X i =

k
Aikτ −θ
ik
k
Ek,
(1)
where Xi is the total sales by region i in the aggregate US market; Aik is the production capability
of region i in industry k; τik is the average iceberg transport cost for region i in shipping goods
in industry k to the aggregate US market;17 θ is the trade cost elasticity; Ek is US aggregate
expenditure on goods in industry k, and k is the competitiveness of the aggregate US market in
industry k, deﬁned as k ≡
i′ Ai′kτ −θ
i′k .18
Consider the impact on traded output in region i of changes in production capabilities in the
regions that supply the United States. Totally differentiating Equation 1, and using ˆx ≡dx/x, we
obtain the following equilibrium condition for the log change in region i’s output:
ˆXi =

16The empirical literature has yet to resolve whether slow regional employment responses to labor demand shocks are the
result of labor-market frictions (e.g., search costs) or economic distortions (e.g., social insurance programs), a distinction that
matters for welfare analyses of changes in the trading environment.
17For expositional simplicity, we treat the aggregate US market—which is in truth a collection of distinct regional markets—as
a single entity. Traded output by region i thus refers to total shipments by the industries in i (e.g., manufacturing) that sell
their output outside the region. Alternative versions of the gravity model differ in terms of how Aik is determined. In Eaton &
Kortum (2002), this value is the product of the location parameter for the distribution of productivity for industry k in region
i and unit production costs for industry k in region i.
18For simplicity, we ignore sales by US regions to foreign markets. Incorporating these sales is straightforward. Equilibrium
conditions not shown include factor-market clearing, to which we return below, and the balance of trade, which is discussed
in the previous section.

where φik ≡Xik/Xi is the share of industry k in region i’s total sales on the US market, ρik ≡Xik/Ek
is the share of region i in total US purchases in industry k, and subscript c indexes China. For
simplicity, we assume that ˆAik = ˆAk −θ ˆwi and that trade costs remained unchanged.19
Equation 2 provides a reduced-form speciﬁcation for estimating the impact of trade shocks
emanating from China on regional economic activity in the United States or other countries.
Most empirical analyses of the China trade shock base estimation on a speciﬁcation similar to
Equation 2 or its industry-level counterpart (see, e.g., Autor et al. 2013a,b and Pierce & Schott
2016). Of primary interest is the rightmost term of Equation 2, which captures the impact of
growth in China’s productive capacity on traded output by US region i. It can be rewritten as

which is the weighted average exposure of region i to changes in US industry import penetration
that is mandated by changes in China’s production capabilities. During the 1990s and 2000s,
advances in Chinese manufacturing were driven by the country’s market transition, which gave its
ﬁrms access to foreign capital, technology, and inputs; allowed capital to move from the public to
the private sector; permitted rural-to-urban migration; and ended restrictions on direct exporting
by private enterprises. The φik weights in Equation 3—the share of each industry in region i’s
total sales on the US market—summarize differences in industry specialization patterns across US
regions and thus capture variation in regional exposure to China’s supply-driven export growth.
3.2. Identifying the Reduced-Form Impact of the China Trade Shock
To estimate the impact of the trade shock in Equation 3 on regional labor-market outcomes, it is
necessary to control for the confounding factors that also affect these outcomes. These confounds
are summarized in the ﬁrst four terms on the right of Equation 2. Anticipating the estimation
approaches that we describe in Section 4, we discuss each of these components in turn.
The ﬁrst term on the right of Equation 2, 
k φik ˆEk, is regional exposure to US industry
demand shocks. Because observed changes in import penetration from China will be affected by
both the ﬁrst and last terms in Equation 2, they will embody changes in both US product demand
and China’s supply conditions. Any reduced-form regression of changes in regional outcomes on
regional trade exposure may thus be contaminated by US product demand shocks. Autor et al.
(2013a,b) propose using Chinese import growth in other high-income markets as an instrument for
the growth in US imports from China to isolate the foreign-supply-driven component of changes
in US import penetration. Speciﬁcally, they instrument the observed change in US industry-level
import penetration from China with a non-US exposure variable that is constructed using data
on contemporaneous industry-level growth of Chinese exports to other high-income markets
(Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland).
Table 1 documents the operation of the Autor-Dorn-Hanson instrumental-variables strategy.
The ﬁrst column of the table shows that annual US imports from China increased by 304 billion
dollars between 1991 and 2007, whereas imports from China grew by 235 billion dollars across the
eight other high-income countries, offering comparable trade data for the full sample period. Both
the United States and the other high-income countries experienced rising imports in almost all of
19The ﬁrst assumption implies that the change in production capability for region i in industry k can be decomposed into the
exogenous change in national productivity in industry k ( ˆAk) and the change in wages in region i ( ˆwi), consistent with Eaton &
Kortum (2002). We thus assume that the exogenous determinants of regional comparative advantage (e.g., the Eaton-Kortum
productivity distribution location parameters) are unchanged.

the 397 harmonized four-digit manufacturing industries, and the pattern of import growth across
industries is highly correlated between the United States and the other countries (correlation
coefﬁcient of 0.92). The remaining columns of the table show the same information separately
for each of the eight other high-income countries. Remarkably, each of the comparison countries
witnessed import growth in at least 343 of the 397 manufacturing industries, and industry patterns
of imports are strongly correlated with the United States, with correlation coefﬁcients ranging
from 0.55 (Switzerland) to 0.96 (Australia). That China made comparable gains in penetration by
detailed sectors across numerous countries in the same time interval suggests that China’s falling
prices, rising quality, and diminishing trade and tariff costs in these surging sectors are a root cause.
A possible threat to this supply-based explanation for Chinese export patterns is that product
demand shocks are correlated across high-income countries, in which case using cross-industry
variation in China’s penetration of other high-income markets as an instrument for US penetration
could confound import growth with unobserved components of demand. Autor et al. (2013a,b)
also utilize a gravity-based strategy that replaces the growth in US imports from China with the
inferred change in China’s comparative advantage and market access vis-`a-vis the United States.
This gravity approach differences out import demand in the purchasing country, thereby retaining
supply and trade-cost-driven changes in China’s export performance. The residuals from this
regression approximate the percentage growth in imports from China due to changes in China’s
productivity and trade costs relative to the United States. Gravity and IV estimates are similar,
which suggests that correlated import demand shocks are not overly important for the estimation.
In the second term on the right of Equation 2, θ ˆwi is the endogenous change in wages in US
region i resulting from external product-market shocks. Most empirical analyses exclude wages as
an independent variable. Estimating Equation 2 without wages on the right-hand side captures
the reduced-form impact of trade exposure on economic activity in region i that works either
directly through changes in industry output or indirectly through feedback effects from changes
in local wages (see Kovak 2013 on the impact of trade shocks on wages in Brazil based on a speciﬁc
factors model). Alternatively, estimating a version of Equation 2 that makes either the change in
regional wages or the change in regional labor supply the dependent variable provides a test of
the geographic mobility of labor in response to trade-induced labor demand shocks.

The third term on the right-hand side of Equation 2, 
k φik ˆAk, captures exposure of region
i to changes in national industry productivity. Another consequence of regions varying in their
specialization patterns is that they will differ in their exposure to sector-biased technological
progress. Are regions that are more subject to technology shocks also ones that tend to face
greater import competition? It appears not. There is near-zero correlation between exposure to
technological change and exposure to trade with China across US local labor markets (Autor et al.
2013b, 2015).20 A related issue, to which we return in Section 4, is whether exposure to trade with
low-wage countries induces ﬁrms to step up innovation, making technology endogenous to trade.
Finally, the fourth term in Equation 2, 
k φik

i′̸=c ρi′k ˆAi′k, captures changes in production
capabilities in other supplying countries. These changes may be in part a response to changes in
supply conditions in China. If we exclude this term from the estimation, we model changes in
supply capabilities in other countries implicitly as a reduced-form function of changes in industry
productivity in China.21
The speciﬁcation in Equation 2 does not comprise an input-output structure. The presence of
intermediate inputs may affect the transmission of trade shocks within the United States. Consider
the case of tire production. If rising imports of Chinese tires cause US tire producers to reduce their
output, demand for US-made synthetic rubber and steel ﬁber, which are used as inputs in domestic
tire production, may decline as well. The trade shock, which began in the US tire industry, would
also affect domestic demand in the industries that supply inputs to US synthetic rubber and steel
ﬁber producers, as the shock works its way up the production chain. A full accounting of the impact
of trade shocks thus requires incorporating input-output linkages between domestic industries
(Pierce & Schott 2016, Acemoglu et al. 2016). A related possibility is that US synthetic rubber and
steel ﬁber producers may beneﬁt from access to lower-cost inputs from China. Recent literature
allows for both channels of transmission, from US ﬁnal goods producers to their domestic input
suppliers and from Chinese input suppliers to US input buyers.
To summarize this discussion, identifying the impact of trade with China on US local labor-
market outcomes requires a valid instrumental variable—or, more broadly, a source of plausibly
exogenous variation—for regional exposure to import competition, controls for regional exposure
to technological change, and recognition that the estimated reduced-form impact may be atten-
uated by labor migration between regions. An alternative approach to identiﬁcation is to utilize
changes in imports that result from changes in trade policy. Topalova (2010), Kovak (2013), and
McLaren & Hakobyan (2016) estimate the change in local incomes or employment due to greater
import competition that arises from tariff reductions mandated by trade reforms in India, Brazil,
and North America, respectively. Tariff reductions are a less obvious source of the increase in im-
ports from China by developed economies. By the early 1990s, most developed nations, including
the United States, already provided China with MFN access to their markets, implying an average
import tariff of less than 4%. Trade barriers in these countries did decline in the late 1990s and
20Autor et al. (2013b, 2015) measure regional technology exposure using an occupational composition index that captures the
opportunities for substitution of computers for workplace tasks. This index is highly correlated with measures of computer
adoption (Autor & Dorn 2013), but it is necessarily incomplete and would not be expected to capture industry-speciﬁc
innovations that deviate from the overall pace of machine-labor substitution.
21China’s manufacturing growth is closely related to the expansion of global production networks in East Asia (Hsieh & Woo
2005). As China has grown, so too has its demand for imported inputs, which it assembles into ﬁnal outputs for shipment
abroad. During the 2000s, approximately half of China’s manufacturing exports were produced by export processing plants,
which are dedicated solely to assembly of imported components (Yu & Tian 2012). Over time, China has begun to produce an
ever greater fraction of the inputs that it uses in export production, as it diversiﬁes away from pure processing trade (Brandt &
Morrow 2014). Koopman et al. (2012) estimate that the share of domestic value added in China’s total exports—the fraction
of China’s exports composed of value added in China—rose from 50% in 1997 to 62% in 2007.

early 2000s, as a result of the Uruguay Round of the GATT, but the average decline was less
than two percentage points, except in apparel and textiles (Bloom et al. 2016). Hence, changes in
applied tariffs would seem to predict no more than modest growth in China’s shipments to the
United States. We discuss below how the observed reduction in US MFN tariffs may not capture
the full impact of changes in US trade barriers on imports from China (Pierce & Schott 2016).
4. LABOR-MARKET ADJUSTMENT TO TRADE
If we suppose that the growth in US manufacturing imports from China was triggered by a
combination of productivity growth and improving foreign market access for Chinese ﬁrms, the
shock that originated across the Paciﬁc would ﬁrst manifest itself in the United States in terms of
more intense competition in product markets. Next, the shock would be transmitted to the regions
in which competing manufacturing industries are concentrated, to the US sectors that supply these
industries with inputs, and to the workers employed in manufacturing and its supplier industries.
In this section, we empirically trace out the impacts of the China trade shock by examining
consequences at each of these levels.
4.1. Industry Adjustment to Import Competition
The initial point of transmission of supply shocks in China to factor markets in the United States
is the product market. Improvements in China’s productive capabilities and reductions in its
trade costs will change the intensity of competition for US goods, leading to a contraction in US
industries subject to greater import exposure. Bernard et al. (2006) use data on US manufacturing
plants for 1977 to 1997 to examine the consequences of increased exposure to import competition
from low-wage countries, which they measure as the share of these economies in US imports, and
which is largely attributable to China.22 They ﬁnd that over ﬁve-year intervals, industries facing
greater increases in exposure to trade are subject to higher rates of plant exit.23 Among the plants
that survive, those in more trade-exposed sectors have larger reductions in employment and a
higher likelihood of changing their primary four-digit manufacturing category.
Acemoglu et al. (2016) provide a complementary analysis to Bernard et al.’s (2006) that moves
the focus to the industry level and extends the data forward in time to cover the period 1991 to
2011.24 Consistent with the logic of Equation 2, they estimate the following model for the impact
of shifts in trade exposure on manufacturing employment:
L jτ = ατ + β1IP jτ + γ X j0 + e jτ.
(4)
Here, L jτ is 100 times the annual log change in employment in industry j over subperiod τ,
IP jτ is 100 times the annual change in import penetration from China in US manufacturing
22This measure does not correspond to the theoretical concept of import penetration in Equation 3. However, because most
of the temporal variation in the Bernard et al. measure is in the numerator—due to China’s massive export growth—the
share of US imports from low-wage countries and the change in US import penetration due to low-wage countries are highly
correlated.
23Similar effects are observed for other countries: Growing Chinese import competition increases plant exit and reduces ﬁrm
growth in Mexico (Iacovone et al. 2013, Utar & Torres-Ruiz 2013) and reduces employment growth in Belgian ﬁrms (Mion
& Zhu 2013), Danish ﬁrms (Utar 2014), and in a panel of ﬁrms from 12 European countries (Bloom et al. 2016).
24In related work, Pierce & Schott (2016) compare sectors that varied in their vulnerability to China’s joining the WTO.
Prior to the 2001 accession, Congress decided annually whether to rescind MFN status on China and impose much higher
non-MFN tariffs. Relative to pre-2001 trends, employment declines after 2001 were greater in US manufacturing industries
that had larger initial gaps between MFN and non-MFN tariffs.

aStatistics are based on 392 four-digit manufacturing industries. The change in US exposure to Chinese imports is computed by dividing 100 times the
annualized increase in the value of US imports over the indicated period by 1991 US market volume in that industry. Employment changes are computed
in the County Business Patterns. All observations are weighted by 1991 industry employment. Table adapted from table 1 in Acemoglu et al. (2016).
industry j over subperiod τ, β1 is the estimated effect of exposure to import competition on industry
employment, Xj0 is a set of industry-speciﬁc start of period controls (suppressed initially), ατ is a
period-speciﬁc constant, and e jτ is an error term.25 Table 2, reproduced from Acemoglu et al.’s
results, shows that the employment-weighted mean industry saw Chinese import exposure rise
by 0.5 percentage points per year between 1991 and 2011, with more rapid penetration in the
period of 1999 through 2007—during China’s WTO accession—than from 1991 through 1999.26
Growth from 2007 to 2011 indicates a marked slowdown in import expansion following the
onset of the global ﬁnancial crisis, which halted trade growth worldwide (Levchenko et al. 2010).
Table 2 also shows that the decline in US manufacturing employment accelerated over time: The
average industry contracted by 0.3 log points per year between 1991 and 1999, by 3.6 log points
per year between 1999 and 2007, and by 5.7 log points per year in the Great Recession period of
2007 to 2011.27
Table 3, also based on Acemoglu et al. (2016), presents estimates of Equation 4 in stacked
ﬁrst differences for the two time periods 1991–1999 and 1999–2011. For these results, the change
in import penetration and a dummy for each time period are the only regressors. In column 1,
which estimates the model without instrumentation, the import penetration variable is negative
and highly signiﬁcant, consistent with the hypothesis that rising import exposure lowers domestic
industry employment. Nevertheless, this ordinary-least-squares point estimate could be biased be-
cause growth in import penetration is driven partly by domestic shocks. Column 2 instruments the
observed changes in industry import penetration with contemporaneous changes in other-country
China imports, as described above. The estimate in column 2 implies that a one-percentage-point
rise in industry import penetration reduces domestic industry employment by 1.3 log points
(t-ratio of 3.2). Column 3, which stacks the periods 1991–1999 and 1999–2007, shows that the
coefﬁcient of import penetration is similar if we restrict attention to the years preceding the Great
Recession.
Although it is clear empirically that employment in import-competing US industries has shrunk
in the face of China’s rapid growth, the challenge for research is how to measure the distributional
25Import penetration is deﬁned here as IP jτ = MUC
j,τ /(Y j,91 + M j,91 −E j,91), where Yj is domestic output, Mj is imports,
Ej is exports, and MUC
j,τ is the change in US imports from China.
26Table 2 slightly aggregates the 397 manufacturing industries of Figure 4 to 392 industries to improve compatibility with
other industry-level data such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) input-output tables.
27Ebenstein et al. (2014) describe how employment conditions change in the industries and occupations that are more exposed
to US multinational companies moving production offshore. In mild contrast to the above results, they ﬁnd that trade exposure
affects employment not through workers’ industry of employment but through their occupation of employment.

consequences and the net economic costs and beneﬁts of these labor-market impacts. The answers
revolve around mechanisms that are not self-evident from the basic facts above; speciﬁcally,
1. Given the spatial concentration of manufacturing, do industry shocks translate into lo-
calized employment shocks—and if so, are they offset or ampliﬁed by local labor-market
mechanisms?
2. To what extent are trade-induced industry employment contractions offset by employment
gains elsewhere in the US economy, potentially outside of trade-impacted regions?
3. Do trade adjustments occur on the employment margin, the wage margin, or both? If on
the employment margin, what are the costs to individual workers and to the public at large?
4. Are the costs of trade adjustment borne disproportionately by workers employed at trade-
impacted ﬁrms and residing in trade-impacted local labor markets? Or do these shocks
diffuse nationally, thus moderating their concentrated effects?
We consider these questions below, highlighting both what is known and what remains
unanswered.
4.2. Regional Employment Impacts
To assess the distributional consequences of rising trade with China, we turn next to adjustments
in local labor markets. Local exposure arises from the tendency of industries to cluster in speciﬁc
regions of a country (Ellison et al. 2010). In the United States, manufacturing employment is par-
ticularly concentrated in parts of the Midwest and Southeast. Even within these manufacturing
regions, there is wide variation in the industry composition of local ﬁrms. Industry composi-
tion may be affected by trade shocks, however. In measuring regional trade exposure, we follow
the literature in utilizing data on regional industry specialization patterns in the preshock pe-
riod, thus preempting any endogenous adjustment of industry location to contemporaneous trade
shocks.

Autor et al. (2013a,b) examine the impact of Chinese competition on US commuting zones
(CZs), drawing on data from the US Census, the American Community Survey, and the County
Business Patterns for the years 1990 to 2007. CZs are clusters of counties that have the commuting
structure of a local labor market (Tolbert & Sizer 1996, Autor & Dorn 2013). Figure 6 shows
the spatial distribution of exposure to increases in Chinese import competition from 1991 to
2007 across CZs. In the map of unconditional import exposure in panel a, some broad regions
have greater vulnerability to imports simply because they are more specialized in manufacturing
overall. For instance, Alabama and Tennessee, both strongly manufacturing oriented, have a
preponderance of trade-exposed CZs. Variation of trade intensity within regions becomes larger
in Figure 6b, which plots import exposure conditional on the share of manufacturing in CZ
employment as of 1990, thus measuring import competition for the local set of manufacturing
industries. When looking within manufacturing, Tennessee, owing largely to its concentration
of furniture producers, is far more exposed to trade with China than is Alabama, which has
agglomerations of relatively insulated heavy industry. This variation of import exposure within
local manufacturing sectors is the basis for much of the econometric analysis we discuss.
Over the period 1990 to 2007—considered either as a single long difference or as stacked
changes for 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2007—CZs that were more exposed to increased import
competition from China experienced substantially larger reductions in manufacturing employ-
ment. Columns 1 to 4 of Table 4, based on Autor et al. (2013a,b), show that the decline in
manufacturing jobs was largely accommodated by an increasing share of a CZ’s working-age pop-
ulation that was unemployed or out of the labor force. Speciﬁcally, a $1,000 increase in a CZ’s
per-worker import exposure reduces the fraction of the working age population employed in man-
ufacturing and nonmanufacturing, respectively, by −0.60 and −0.18 percentage points (the latter
of which is not signiﬁcant), and raises the fraction of unemployed and out of the labor force by
0.22 and 0.55 percentage points.28 Autor et al. (2013a,b) further document that this ﬁnding holds
for workers at all education levels. For workers with less than a college education, increased trade
exposure also predicts signiﬁcant reductions in CZ employment in nonmanufacturing industries,
suggesting the presence of negative local demand spillovers.
Column 5 of Table 4 further shows that import competition has modest effects on the size
of the working-age population in CZs. Tracing individual workers over time, Autor et al. (2014)
conﬁrm that there is little geographic migration in response to the trade shock.29
Thus, the industry-level impacts of Chinese import competition seen in Table 3 are equally
visible within local labor markets. Contrary to the canonical understanding of US labor markets
as ﬂuid and ﬂexible, trade-induced manufacturing declines in CZs are not, over the course of a
decade, largely offset by sectoral reallocation or labor mobility. Instead, overall CZ employment-
to-population rates fall at least one-for-one with the decline in manufacturing employment,
and generally by slightly more. These results run counter to a precept of general equilibrium
trade theory that the local employment effect of sectoral demand shocks should be short-lived,
as the forces of wage and price arbitrage and labor mobility dissipate these shocks nationally.
28The import per worker measure is a variant of Equation 3 that uses data on local employment by industry to proxy for
the sales and expenditure variables φik and Ek. It can be interpreted as assigning national imports by industry to CZs based
on CZs’ shares in national industry employment, and normalizing the imports assigned to a CZ by total CZ employment.
A $1,000 increase in annual imports per worker during a decade corresponds approximately to the difference in the trade
exposure between CZs at the 75th versus 25th percentile of import exposure during 1990–2007.
29Population responses to local trade shocks are also limited in other countries. Analyses from Germany (Dauth et al. 2014)
and Spain (Donoso et al. 2014) both ﬁnd weak and statistically insigniﬁcant population adjustments in local labor markets
that are exposed to import competition from low-wage counties.

Trade-induced shocks to local manufacturing employment should affect the allocation of labor
across sectors but should have no measurable impact on employment rates in directly impacted
CZs relative to the national labor market. That this neoclassical prediction does not appear to
hold even approximately over the span of a decade suggests that the labor-market impacts of
trade shocks are likely to be ampliﬁed by slow and incomplete adjustment: Rather than modestly
reducing wage levels among low-skill workers nationally, these shocks catalyze signiﬁcant falls in
employment rates within trade-impacted local labor markets.30
30Labor market adjustment to import competition from China may also be incomplete because the trade shock continues to
accumulate over time as imports from China grow. In the case of Brazil, however, Dix-Carneiro & Kovak (2015) also ﬁnd
little spatial mobility and regional convergence in the years following a one-time trade liberalization shock.

Regional labor-market consequences from exposure to trade with China have also been stud-
ied for countries other than the United States. Analyses for Norway (Balsvik et al. 2015) and for
Spain (Donoso et al. 2014), covering periods from the late 1990s to 2007, ﬁnd results that are
consistent with the US evidence. Regions that face greater import competition experienced a dif-
ferential decline in manufacturing employment. Lower manufacturing employment was primarily
compensated by higher unemployment in Norway and by greater employment outside of man-
ufacturing in Spain. Dauth et al. (2014) ﬁnd that in Germany, Chinese import competition also
had a negative impact on manufacturing employment in local labor markets. In the German case,
the impact of rising Chinese import competition between 1988 and 2008 was compounded by an
even more rapid growth of imports from Eastern Europe following the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Distinct from the US case, German manufacturers sharply increased exports to these lower-wage
countries, resulting in a more modest trade deﬁcit with China and a trade surplus with Eastern
Europe. The employment gains related to these export opportunities roughly offset the job losses
from import competition in the case of China, whereas they actually raise German employment
in the case of trade with Eastern Europe.
Although this review’s focus is on the consequences of increased import exposure to China,
this was not the only trade shock to affect local labor markets in the United States over the
past two decades. The North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted in 1994, stands out as
a landmark change in US trade policy, which led to the elimination of tariffs on US imports
from Mexico for the large majority of manufactured products.31 Similar to Topalova’s (2010)
analysis for India and Kovak’s (2013) for Brazil, McLaren & Hakobyan (2016) estimate the impact
of NAFTA tariff changes on wages in US regions (deﬁned as Consistent Public Use Microdata
31US trade with Canada was liberalized earlier in 1989 through the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (Treﬂer
2004).

Areas) between 1990 and 2000. They allow workers to be affected by tariff reductions either directly
through their industry of employment—where industries varied both in the magnitude and the
speed of the tariff cuts—or indirectly through the specialization of their local labor market in
NAFTA-exposed sectors. Both direct and indirect channels of transmission are important for wage
outcomes. Wage growth for high-school dropouts employed in the industries that were initially
the most protected, and therefore subject to the largest tariff declines, was 17 percentage points
lower than for comparable workers employed in initially unprotected industries. Additionally,
high-school dropouts employed in locations that were initially the most specialized in industries
vulnerable to NAFTA had a wage growth that was eight percentage points lower than for similarly
educated workers in locations with few protected industries. Surprisingly, the next most affected
labor-market group is workers with some college education. NAFTA wage impacts for high-school
educated workers are comparatively modest and for the college educated, effectively zero.
4.3. National Impacts Versus Regional Impacts
The localized impacts of import competition measure the relative effect of the China trade shock
on more versus less trade-exposed regional labor markets. Should we take these results to mean
that trade-impacted locations suffered employment declines in absolute terms, or simply that they
beneﬁted less relative to trade-insulated locations? This distinction between relative and absolute
effects matters. The former encompasses the distributional effects of trade, whereas the latter
bears on the magnitude of the net gains from trade.
Using an expanded version of Equation 4, Acemoglu et al. (2016) assess whether the seem-
ingly adverse industry- and region-level impacts are offset by employment responses elsewhere
in the economy. Looking across US manufacturing industries whose outputs compete with Chi-
nese import goods, they estimate that had import penetration from China not grown after 1999,
there would have been 560,000 fewer manufacturing jobs lost through the year 2011. Actual US
manufacturing employment declined by 5.8 million workers from 1999 to 2011, making the coun-
terfactual job loss from direct import competition amount to 10% of the realized job decline. As
these results are based on the reduced-form speciﬁcation of Equation 2, they may not, however,
capture the full general equilibrium consequences of trade.
Negative shocks to one industry are transmitted to other industries via economic linkages
between sectors. One source of such linkages is buyer-supplier relationships (Acemoglu et al. 2012).
Rising import competition in apparel and furniture—two sectors in which China is strong—will
cause these “downstream” industries to reduce purchases from the “upstream” sectors that supply
them with fabric, lumber, and textile and woodworking machinery. Because buyers and suppliers
often locate near one another, much of the impact of increased trade exposure in downstream
industries is likely to transmit to suppliers in the same regional or national market. Acemoglu
et al. (2016) use US input-output data to construct upstream import exposure shocks for both
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries. Estimates from this exercise indicate negative
employment effects in industries that sell outputs to directly trade-exposed industries, from which
trade exposure propagates upstream in the supply chain.32 Applying the direct plus the indirect
input-output measure of exposure increases estimates of trade-induced job losses for 1999 to
2011 to 985,000 workers in manufacturing, and to 2.0 million workers in the entire economy.
Interindustry linkages thus magnify the employment effects of trade shocks, almost doubling the
32Pierce & Schott (2016) and Federico (2014) ﬁnd qualitatively similar results for the United States and Italy, respectively.

size of the impact within manufacturing and producing an equally large employment effect outside
of manufacturing.33
Two additional sources of linkages between sectors operate through changes in aggregate de-
mand and the broader reallocation of labor. When manufacturing contracts, workers who have
lost their jobs or suffered declines in their earnings reduce their spending on goods and services.
The contraction in demand is multiplied throughout the economy, depressing consumption and
investment. Helping offset these negative aggregate demand effects, workers who exit manufac-
turing may take up jobs in the service sector or elsewhere in the economy, replacing some of the
earnings lost in trade-exposed industries. Because aggregate demand and reallocation effects work
in opposing directions, we can only detect their net impact on aggregate employment.
To adjudicate among these mechanisms, Acemoglu et al. (2016) supplement their analysis of US
industries with an analysis of US CZs that adds an input-output structure to Autor et al. (2013a,b).
If the reallocation mechanism is operative, then when a local industry contracts as a result of
Chinese competition, some other industry in the same CZs should expand. Aggregate demand
effects should also operate within local labor markets, as shown by Mian & Suﬁ(2014) in the
context of the recent US housing bust. If increased trade exposure lowers aggregate employment
in a location, reduced earnings will decrease spending on nontraded local goods and services, thus
magnifying the local impact. Estimates of the net impact of aggregate demand and reallocation
effects imply that import growth from China between 1999 and 2011 led to an employment
reduction of 2.4 million workers. Although the employment losses are concentrated in industries
that are either directly exposed to import competition or indirectly via input-output linkages,
there is little evidence for substantial offsetting employment gains in local industries that are not
exposed to the trade shock. The estimated employment decline is larger than the 2.0 million job
loss estimate obtained for national industries, which only captures direct and input-output effects.
It may still not capture the full consequences of the China shock on US employment, however, as
neither the analysis for CZs nor that for national industries fully incorporates all of the adjustment
channels encompassed by the other. The national industry estimates exclude reallocation and
aggregate demand effects, whereas the CZ estimates exclude the national component of these two
effects, as well as nonlocal input-output linkages.
Are there positive employment effects from US trade with China that the literature may be
missing? One mechanism may work through the supply of imported inputs. The expanded ability
of US ﬁrms to offshore production to China may raise productivity for workers in the United
States (Grossman & Rossi-Hansberg 2008), lower the relative price of intermediates (Auer et al.
2013), or extend the range of ﬁnal goods that ﬁrms are capable of producing (Goldberg et al. 2010).
Although such beneﬁts are plausible in theory and have been found in other national contexts,
neither Pierce & Schott (2016) nor Autor et al. (2013a,b) detect evidence of positive US industry
or regional employment responses to increased imported input supply. A second mechanism may
be that increased competition in ﬁnal goods markets alters investments in innovation. Bloom et al.
(2016) show that European apparel and textile ﬁrms that faced greater competition from China
following the elimination of quotas under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement produced more patents,
had higher productivity growth, and boosted purchases of new technology. Although intensiﬁed
product-market competition may raise the incentive for innovation, it can just as easily work in
33Although the employment impact of upstream import exposure is signiﬁcantly negative, the impact of downstream import
exposure is estimated to be small and insigniﬁcant in aggregate. Point estimates suggest that manufacturing industries may
expand employment when their supplier industries become exposed to Chinese competition (consistent with lower input
prices), whereas employment outside manufacturing is negatively affected by shocks that propagate downstream (e.g., reduced
employment in a wholesale business that used to buy locally produced manufactures).

the opposite direction. The aggregate impact of Chinese competition on US innovation remains
unknown.34
The reduced-form analysis suggests that the reallocation of labor across US industries and
regions in response to increased competition from China does not produce an offsetting increase
in employment by other US traded-good industries, as the simple logic of neoclassical trade theory
would have predicted. Other indirect gains from trade with China are, in principle, still possible.
One explanation for the extremely modest offsetting employment increase in nonexposed sectors
in the United States may be related to the rapid contemporaneous rise in the US aggregate trade
deﬁcit, a substantial part of which reﬂects a growing trade imbalance with China. When faced with
greater import competition, an open economy normally reallocates resources out of some tradable
industries into others, at least under balanced trade. If, however, the trade shock is accompanied by
a rise in the trade deﬁcit, then the reallocation from exposed tradables into tradables not exposed
to China may be delayed, shifting employment into nontradables instead. Although this reasoning
still predicts a long-run employment reallocation toward nonexposed tradables, the large and
growing US trade deﬁcit during the period under study may have signiﬁcantly slowed such a
reallocation.
4.4. Wage and Transfer Impacts
Employment is not the only margin of labor-market response to trade shocks. Column 6 of
Table 4 shows that more trade-exposed CZs experience larger reductions in average weekly wages.
Extending the analysis in Autor et al. (2013a,b) using quantile regression, Chetverikov et al. (2016)
document that these wage impacts of CZ-level trade exposure are concentrated among workers
in the bottom four wage deciles. The reduction in wages is not limited to manufacturing, but
indeed is concentrated outside that sector. Although the shock to manufacturing industries seems
to affect local wages more broadly, the presence of differential wage impacts of trade across CZs
suggests that these labor markets are indeed local, as spatial mobility is not sufﬁciently large to
equilibrate wages at the national level.35
The estimates of Table 4 allow a simple calculation of the relative importance of employment
and wage adjustments for the overall decline in earnings in trade-exposed CZs. Given average an-
nual earnings of approximately $40,000 per worker, a reduction of employment by 0.78 percentage
points (sum of columns 1 and 2) per $1,000 dollars of imports per worker lowers earnings per adult
by approximately $312 per year (0.0078 × 40,000). The same shock reduces the average weekly
wage by 0.76 log points among the approximately 70% of working-age adults who are employed,
which implies an additional earnings loss per adult of $213 per year (0.0076 × 0.7 × 40,000).
34A further issue is that measured input-output linkages may miss some positive demand effects from US exports. Consider
the iPhone, whose back panel states, “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” From its US headquarters,
Apple offshores production to Foxconn, which employs 300,000 workers in its iPhone operations in China. If productivity in
Foxconn rises, iPhone sales may expand, thereby increasing demand for design services among Apple’s 50,000 US employees.
However, not all of Apple’s design exports to China may appear in US trade data. For tax purposes, Apple may attribute some
iPhone revenues to overseas subsidiaries. These revenues would not appear in the US current account until the earnings are
repatriated, possibly far in the future. A similar logic applies to US business services that may expand as a result of increased
trade with China.
35Local labor market analyses for other developed countries ﬁnd signiﬁcant wage declines in response to import competition
in Norway (Balsvik et al. 2015) and Spain (Donoso et al. 2014), and an insigniﬁcant wage reduction in Germany (Dauth et al.
2014). In related work on a developing economy, Costa et al. (2014) analyze the Brazilian experience of trade with China
during the period 2000 to 2010, which saw rising Brazilian exports of raw materials and growing imports of manufactured
goods. Whereas Brazilian regions specializing in raw materials experienced rising wages, those competing with imported
Chinese manufactures suffered wage losses, especially in low-skilled occupations.

Although trade theory has typically emphasized the impact of trade shocks on wages, these results
suggest that adjustments at the employment margin might have an even larger quantitative impact
on workers’ earnings.36
A direct consequence of reduced employment and wages in trade-exposed local labor markets
is an increase in transfer beneﬁts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more trade-exposed CZs see larger
increases in per capita payouts of Unemployment Insurance and Trade Adjustment Assistance
(TAA) (Figure 7; see also Autor et al. 2013a,b), both of which are designed to assist laid-off
workers. However, the impacts of trade shocks on transfer payments extend far beyond those
tied to temporary downturns. Because trade-induced declines in local employment and wages
appear persistent, a larger fraction of households in a CZ is likely to qualify for means-tested
entitlements. As Figure 7 documents, more trade-exposed CZs experience larger per capita growth
in publicly provided medical care, consistent with more households qualifying for income-based
health beneﬁts, and in government income assistance, consistent with more households meeting
the threshold for welfare payouts. Trade exposure also contributes to an increase in disability
beneﬁts, whose take-up is typically associated with permanent exit from the labor force (Autor &
Duggan 2003). Retirement beneﬁts rise in more trade-exposed CZs, suggesting that adverse labor-
market shocks induce more workers to retire earlier (see Kondo 2013 for a general equilibrium
analysis of the welfare consequences of trade-related employment losses, and Feler & Senses 2015
36This ﬁnding has precedence in the literature on labor-market responses to trade. Using data on US manufacturing industries
in the 1960s and 1970s, Grossman (1987) ﬁnds that adjustment to changes in import competition occurs primarily in terms
of industry employment and only secondarily in terms of wages.

for results on the impact of the China trade shock on the provision of public services across local
jurisdictions).
What is striking about the impact of trade shocks on beneﬁt take-up is not just the size of
these effects—for every extra $100 in local import exposure per worker transfer receipts rise
by approximately $6 per capita—but also their relative magnitudes across categories. TAA, the
primary federal government program intended to help workers who lose their jobs as a result of
foreign competition (Baicker & Rehavi 2004), is effectively inconsequential in local adjustment
to trade shocks. Workers eligible for TAA receive extended unemployment beneﬁts of up to
18 months, as long as they remain enrolled in a training program, and may obtain allowances
toward relocation, job search, and healthcare.37 Trade-exposed CZs certainly experience sharp
relative growth in per capita receipts of TAA beneﬁts. However, although TAA reacts elastically
to trade exposure, it is far from the transfer category that responds most strongly in terms of
dollar expenditure; the total volume of TAA spending is negligible relative to many other transfer
programs. A more trade-exposed CZ (deﬁned to be one at the 75th percentile of change in imports
per worker over the period 1991–2007) would see an increased per capita take-up of TAA of only
$0.23 when compared to a less trade-exposed CZ (deﬁned to be one at the 25th percentile of change
in importers per worker); spending grows by more than $15 per capita for each of three categories:
medical beneﬁts, federal income assistance, and Social Security retirement and disability beneﬁts
(Figure 7).
Despite the responsiveness of local transfer payments to local import exposure, on the whole
there appears to be limited regional redistribution of trade gains from winners to losers. Comparing
again the residents of CZs at the 75th and 25th percentile of import exposure, those in the more
exposed location experience a reduction in annual household wage and salary income per adult
of $549, whereas per capita transfer income rises by approximately $58, thereby offsetting just a
small portion of the earnings loss (see columns 7 and 8 of Table 4).38
4.5. Worker-Level Impacts
The evidence above suggests that trade adjustment is a slow-moving process, and that its costs fall
heavily on trade-exposed local markets rather than being dispersed nationally. What these analyses
do not answer is to what degree costs are born speciﬁcally by workers employed at trade-impacted
ﬁrms rather than more broadly among comparably skilled workers in a locality. If, within industries
and local labor markets, adverse trade effects are dispersed among workers of comparable skills,
the person-level costs of these shocks will be moderated. Alternatively, if, due to labor-market
frictions or skill speciﬁcity, the impact falls disproportionately on workers directly employed at
import-competing establishments—and even more so on relatively low-skill workers within these
establishments—the adverse distributional consequences of trade exposure may be larger still.
Trade theory identiﬁes a wide range of mechanisms through which trade shocks will have
differential effects across individuals. HO reasoning suggests that the impacts of freer trade on
real incomes will vary according to an individual’s skill level. In a frictionless labor market, rapid
mobility of workers across ﬁrms, industries, and regions guarantees that wages adjust uniformly
37To qualify for TAA, workers must show that their employer cut back production because of import competition, relocated
production to a country with which the US has a trade agreement, or lost business with a buyer or supplier that is TAA
certiﬁed.
38However, household income is measured per adult (given only adults generate income), whereas transfer income is measured
per capita including children (given some transfers are based on the presence of children). A household with children might
thus offset somewhat more than 10% of its earnings loss.

within skill groups in response to a trade shock, even if only a subset of industries or regions are
directly exposed to trade. Under imperfect worker mobility across jobs, trade shocks can have
heterogeneous impacts within skill groups. Several recent models of labor-market adjustment to
trade incorporate switching costs for workers who wish to move across sectors. Structural estimates
of these models suggest that those costs may amount to several months or even several years of a
worker’s earnings (Artuc¸ et al. 2010, Dix-Carneiro 2014, Pessoa 2016, Ashournia 2015).39 Labor-
market frictions may also stem from search costs for ﬁrms (Helpman et al. 2010). These frictions
tie worker outcomes to changes in foreign competition in the initial ﬁrm, industry, or region of
employment. Until recently, there has been little evidence on how individual workers adjust to
trade shocks.40
Autor et al. (2014) examine the impact of import competition from China on the careers of
individual workers using longitudinal data from the US Social Security Administration. Their
analysis contrasts the labor-market outcomes of workers who were ex ante observationally similar
except for their initial industry of employment.41 Workers whose 1991 industry subsequently
became exposed to higher import penetration accumulate substantially lower earnings over the
period of 1992 to 2007, compared to their peers with similar demographic characteristics and
previous labor-market outcomes. These workers also experience greater job churning. They spend
fewer years working for their initial ﬁrm, more years working outside their initial industry, and
more years receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). This trade-induced job mobility
is however not sufﬁcient to equilibrate career earnings between more and less trade-exposed
workers.
Why don’t employment transitions allow initially trade-exposed workers to fully recoup de-
clines in earnings with the initial employer? The literature on job loss provides one potential
answer (e.g., Neal 1995): Displacement destroys industry-speciﬁc human capital, leaving affected
workers in positions for which they are poorly suited relative to nondisplaced workers. A parallel
explanation is that workers’ speciﬁc skills cause them to seek positions in which they remain ex-
posed to import competition, notwithstanding the predilection of trade-impacted workers to exit
their original two-digit sector. Figure 8 provides insight into this latter mechanism by depicting
the correlation between workers’ trade exposure at their initial employers and at their current
employers for each year between 1991 and 2007.42 In the years immediately following 1991, few
workers had separated from their original ﬁrms, and hence the correlation remains close to 1. Over
time, the correlation between initial and current ﬁrm trade exposure falls, as job transitions proceed
apace, but remains strongly positive, leveling off at 0.43 in the ﬁnal year (2007). As a benchmark
against which to evaluate the persistence of trade exposure, the ﬁgure also plots counterfactual
correlations in which trade exposure at any new employer is set to zero, such that the reported
series summarizes the cumulative likelihood of having left the initial ﬁrm after the number of
years indicated on the horizontal axis. Logically, this counterfactual correlation also declines over
39Allowing for switching costs across both industries and occupations, Artuc¸ & McLaren (2015) also ﬁnd substantial costs of
occupational reallocation.
40Hummels et al. (2014) use data for Denmark to analyze the impacts of increased ﬁrm-level imports on within-job spell
earnings for workers.
41There may, of course, be unobserved factors that affect how workers sort themselves across industries. Sorting based on
unobservables would matter for the analysis if workers who were predisposed to lower lifetime earnings growth dispropor-
tionately selected themselves into industries subject to future import competition from China.
42The correlations compare the 1991–2007 growth of import penetration between the industry that employed a worker in
1991 and the industry that employed a worker in the subsequent year indicated on the x-axis. This correlation is 1.0 in 1991
by construction.

counterfactual data series sets trade exposure to 0 for all ﬁrms except the worker’s initial employer. It refers to
a hypothetical scenario in which no worker joins a trade-exposed ﬁrm after separating from their initial ﬁrm;
as such, the persistence in trade exposure results from workers who have not separated from their initial ﬁrm.
time, reﬂecting the rising likelihood of having departed from the original place of work. But the
counterfactual decline is far more rapid than the actual series and ends up at the much lower level
of 0.17 in 2007. By implication, were trade-exposed workers to exit manufacturing immediately
after the ﬁrst job separation, their net subsequent exposure would be 60% lower than in the actual
data. Thus, even after changing employers, initially trade-exposed workers appear likely to remain
in high-exposure industries, which are subject to further trade shocks.
Although trade shocks disrupt the careers of both high-wage and low-wage individuals, there
is also substantial heterogeneity in patterns of adjustment. Workers whose preperiod wage falls
in the top earnings tercile of their birth cohort react to the trade exposure of their initial ﬁrm
primarily by relocating to ﬁrms outside the manufacturing sector. They do not experience an
earnings loss relative to their peers who started out in less trade-exposed industries. By contrast,
workers in the bottom tercile of preperiod earnings relocate primarily within the manufacturing
sector, and often remain in industries that are hit by subsequent increases in import competition.
These low-wage workers suffer large differential earnings losses, as they obtain lower earnings per
year both while working at the initial ﬁrm and after relocating to new employers.43 Labor-market
adjustment to trade further varies according to workers’ initial labor-force attachment. Among
43Conditional on similar initial annual earnings and other observable conditions of employment, men and women experience
similar consequences from an increase in exposure to import competition. Within manufacturing, women are dispropor-
tionately likely to hold low-wage jobs. Therefore, unconditional on other observables, women within the sector are more
adversely affected by the trade shock than are men.

lower-attachment workers (but not among higher-attachment workers), greater trade exposure
results in fewer calendar years in which their main income comes from earnings, and more calendar
years where SSDI is the main source of recorded income.
Patterns of worker-level adjustment to Chinese import competition have also been studied
for numerous European countries. Pessoa’s (2016) analysis for the United Kingdom shows that
workers whose initial industries became exposed to Chinese import competition accumulated
signiﬁcantly lower earnings over the period 2000 to 2007. This earnings differential results both
from fewer years of employment and from lower hourly earnings while employed. For the case of
Denmark, Ashournia et al. (2014) similarly ﬁnd a negative impact of the China shock on workers’
earnings accumulation between 1997 and 2008, whereas Utar (2015) shows adverse earnings and
employment outcomes for workers whose industries were subject to the removal of Multi-Fiber
Agreement (MFA) quotas. As in the United States, earnings losses are concentrated among low-
skill workers.44 Both these reduced-form results and structural estimates of models with sectoral
switching costs suggest that workers in import-competing sectors bear differential adjustment
costs in reaction to the China trade shock.
5. (RE)ASSESSING THE GAINS FROM TRADE
China’s economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions of individuals out of poverty. The re-
sulting positive impacts on the material well-being of Chinese citizens are abundantly evident.
Beijing’s seven ring roads, Shanghai’s sparkling skyline, and Guangzhou’s multitude of export
factories—none of which existed in 1980—are indicative of China’s success. What makes China
so interesting to economists, in part, is that the timing of this growth was dictated by forces inter-
nal to the country and was therefore hard for outsiders to forecast. To maintain power, Mao was
willing to subject China to a state of near perpetual political and economic upheaval, beginning
with the collectivization of agriculture (1950–1953), continuing on to the Great Leap Forward
(1958–1961), and culminating in the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). At each successive junc-
ture, China fell further behind the rest of the world economically. Its reversal of fortune under
Deng began tenuously before consolidating into the most rapid accumulation of wealth in human
history.
If one had to project the impact of China’s momentous economic reform for the US labor mar-
ket with nothing to go on other than a standard undergraduate international economics textbook,
one would predict large movements of workers between US tradable industries (say, from apparel
and furniture to pharmaceuticals and jet aircrafts), limited reallocation of jobs from tradables to
nontradables, and no net impacts on US aggregate employment. The reality of adjustment to the
China trade shock has been far different. Employment has certainly fallen in US industries more
exposed to import competition; however, overall employment in the local labor markets in which
these industries were concentrated has as well. Offsetting regional employment gains either in
export-oriented tradables or in nontradables has been difﬁcult to detect in the data. Input-output
linkages between sectors appear to have magniﬁed rather than dampened the employment effects
of trade both within regions and nationally.
How should labor-market responses to trade with China change the way that economists think
about the gains from trade for the US and other developed countries? One way is by recharac-
terizing the sets of individuals who are likely candidates for opposing distributional consequences
44In other work, Donoso et al. (2015) study year-to-year labor market transitions in Spain over the period 1997 to 2011 and
ﬁnd that import competition from China increases the likelihood that workers transition from employment to unemployment
and from employment in manufacturing to employment outside that sector.

from economic integration. The literature is perhaps too comfortable with characterizing factor
markets in terms of just two national skill types, such that the essential margin of adjustment is
the relative wage of more- and less-skilled labor.45 Without question, a worker’s position in the
wage distribution is indicative of her exposure to import competition. In response to a given trade
shock, a lower-wage employee experiences larger proportionate reductions in annual and lifetime
earnings, a diminished ability to exit a job before an adverse shock hits, and a greater likelihood of
exiting the labor market, relative to her higher-wage coworker. However, the intensity of action
along other margins of adjustment means that we will misrepresent the welfare impacts of trade
shocks unless we also account for a worker’s local labor market, initial industry of employment,
and starting employer.
The importance of location for evaluating trade gains depends on how long it takes for regional
adjustment to occur. A presumption that US labor markets are smoothly integrated across space
has long made regional equilibration the starting point for welfare analysis. The US experience
of trade with China makes this starting point less compelling. Labor-market adjustment to trade
shocks is stunningly slow, with local labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and local
unemployment rates remaining elevated for a full decade or more after a shock commences. The
persistence of local decline perhaps explains the breadth of public transfer programs whose uptake
increases in regions subject to rising trade exposure. The mobility costs that rationalize slow ad-
justment imply that short-run trade gains may be much smaller than long-run gains and that spatial
heterogeneity in the magnitudes of the net beneﬁts may be much greater than previously thought.
Using a quantitative theoretical model, Caliendo et al. (2015) ﬁnd that in the immediate aftermath
of a trade shock, constructed to mimic the effects of growth in US imports from China, US net
welfare gains are close to zero. The ultimate and sizable net gains are realized only once workers
are able to reallocate across regions to move from declining to expanding industries. Establishing
the speed of regional labor-market adjustment to trade shocks should capture considerably more
attention from trade and labor economists.
In a modern gravity-type trade model, moving from autarky to freer trade expands the set
of product varieties to which consumers have access and thereby raises real income in inverse
proportion to the change in the share of spending a country devotes to domestically produced
goods (Arkolakis et al. 2012).46 Labor immobility amends this logic and gives local comparative
advantage a central role in the analysis of trade gains. If workers cannot move between local
labor markets easily or quickly and local patterns of comparative advantage are ﬁxed—at least
temporarily—the national gains from trade will depend both on the standard gravity mechanism
of changing expenditure shares and on how easily workers within localities can re-sort into new
industries. Galle et al. (2015) demonstrate that in the limiting case where worker re-sorting is
infeasible—such that both regional and worker comparative advantages are locked in—a trade
shock of the same magnitude as the China surge would yield geographic dispersion in welfare
gains whose standard deviation across regions equals twice the national mean. As the literature
develops a clearer picture of the permanence of local comparative advantage, economic models will
be better equipped to quantify the spatial dispersion in net beneﬁts from trade within a country.
The great China trade experiment may soon be over, if it is not already. The country is moving
beyond the period of catch up associated with its market transition and becoming a middle-income
45Analyses based on the speciﬁc-factors model (e.g., Kovak 2013) are of course immune to this criticism.
46Even in this seemingly benign setting, any individual country could lose from China’s rise. Although productivity growth
in China would necessarily raise welfare by expanding the product varieties to which a country has access, it may also—
depending on the sectors affected—depress national incomes by attenuating home-market effects or deteriorating the terms
of trade (Hsieh & Ossa 2015).

nation. Rapidly rising real wages indicate that the end of cheap labor in China is near (Li et al.
2012). Its comparative advantage in the future will likely be less about its labor abundance and
random initial industry prowesses, and more about the endogenous responses of business and
government to the global economic environment. Although the China of the future will surely
look different than the China of the past, the exceptional nature of its progression from Mao to
Deng to today provides a rich vein for analysis that economists have far from exhausted.
