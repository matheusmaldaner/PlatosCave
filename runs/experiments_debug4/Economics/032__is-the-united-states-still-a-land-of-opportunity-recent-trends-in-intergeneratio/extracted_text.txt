There is a growing public perception that 
intergenerational income mobility—a child’s 
chance of moving up in the income distribution 
relative to her parents—is declining in the United 
States. We present new evidence on trends in 
intergenerational mobility using administrative 
earnings records for children born between 1971 
and 1993. For the 1971–1986 birth cohorts, we 
measure intergenerational mobility based on the 
correlation between parent and child income 
percentile ranks. For more recent cohorts, we 
measure mobility as the correlation between a 
child’s probability of attending college and her 
parents’ income rank. We also calculate transi-
tion probabilities, such as a child’s chances of

reaching the top quintile of the income distri-
bution starting from the bottom quintile. Based 
on all of these measures, we find that children 
entering the labor market today have the same 
chances of moving up in the income distribution 
(relative to their parents) as children born in the 
1970s.
Although these rank-based measures of 
mobility have remained stable, income inequal-
ity increased over time in our sample, consistent 
with prior work. Hence, the consequences of the 
“birth lottery”—the parents to whom a child is 
born—are larger today than in the past. A useful 
visual analogy is to envision the income distribu-
tion as a ladder, with each percentile represent-
ing a different rung. The rungs of the ladder have 
grown further apart (inequality has increased), 
but children’s chances of climbing from lower 
to higher rungs have not changed (rank-based 
mobility has remained stable).
This paper is an abbreviated version of NBER 
working paper 19844 (Chetty et al. 2014b). 
The working paper contains a complete descrip-
tion of the data, additional empirical results, and 
further discussion of the findings in the context 
of the prior literature.
I.  Measuring Intergenerational Mobility: 
Conceptual Issues
We decompose the joint distribution of parent 
and child income into two components: (i) the 
joint distribution of parent and child ranks, for-
mally known as the copula of the distribution, 
and (ii) the marginal distributions of parent and 
child income. The marginal distributions deter-
mine the degree of inequality within each gen-
eration, typically measured by Gini ­coefficients

or top income shares. The copula is a key deter-
minant of mobility across generations. Some 
commonly used measures of mobility—such 
as correlations between parent and child per-
centile ranks and quintile transition matrices—
depend purely on the copula. Other measures, 
such as the log-log intergenerational elasticity of 
income, combine features of the marginal distri-
butions and the copula.
We characterize changes in the copula and 
marginal distributions of income separately to 
distinguish changes in inequality from inter-
generational mobility. We find that the copula 
has not changed over time: children’s chances 
of moving up or down in the income distribu-
tion have remained stable. However, the mar-
ginal distributions of income have widened 
substantially.
Together, these two facts can be used 
to construct various measures of mobility. 
For example, if one defines mobility based on 
relative positions in the income distribution—
e.g., a child’s prospects of rising from the bot-
tom to the top quintile—then intergenerational 
mobility has remained unchanged in recent 
decades. If instead one defines mobility based 
on the probability that a child from a low-income 
family (e.g., the bottom 20 percent) reaches a 
fixed upper-income threshold (e.g., $100,000), 
then mobility has increased because of the 
increase in inequality. However, the increase 
in inequality has also magnified the difference 
in expected incomes between children born to­ 
low- (e.g., ­bottom-quintile) versus high- 
(­top-quintile) income families. In this sense, 
mobility has fallen because a child’s income 
depends more heavily on her parents’ position 
in the income distribution today than in the past.
Since the appropriate definition of intergen-
erational mobility depends upon one’s norma-
tive objective, we characterize the copula and 
marginal distributions separately in this paper.
II.  Data
Sample Construction.—For children born 
during or after 1980, we construct a linked 
­parent-child sample using population tax records 
spanning 1996–2012. This ­population-based 
sample consists of all individuals born between 
1980–1993 who are US citizens as of 2013 and 
are claimed as a dependent on a tax return filed in 
or after 1996. We link approximately 95 percent 
of children in each birth cohort to parents based 
on dependent claiming, obtaining a sample with 
3.7 million children per cohort (online Appendix 
Table 1, column 4).
To obtain data on earlier birth cohorts, we use 
the Statistics of Income (SOI) annual cross sec-
tions since 1987, the earliest year with depen-
dent information (Auten, Gee, and Turner 2013). 
These cross sections are stratified random sam-
ples covering approximately 0.1 percent of tax 
returns. Using the SOI ­cross sections, we con-
struct a sample of children in the 1971–1982 
birth cohorts, which we refer to as the SOI sam-
ple. We construct this sample by first identifying 
children between the ages of 12 and 16 claimed 
as dependents in the 1987–1998 SOI cross sec-
tions and then pooling all the SOI cross sections 
that contain information for a given birth cohort. 
Using the sampling weights, we estimate that the 
SOI sample represents 88 percent of children in 
each birth cohort based on vital statistics counts, 
with slightly lower coverage rates in the earliest 
cohorts (online Appendix Table 1, column 3). 
Summary statistics for the SOI sample (using 
sampling weights) and the population-based 
sample are very similar for the overlapping 1980–
1982 birth cohorts (online Appendix Table 2).
Variable Definitions.—We define parent fam-
ily income (in real 2012 dollars) as adjusted 
gross income plus tax exempt interest and the 
nontaxable portion of social security benefits 
for those who file tax returns. For nonfilers, 
we define income as the sum of wage earn-
ings (form W-2), unemployment benefits (form 
1099-G), and social security and disability ben-
efits (form SSA-1099). In years where parents 
have no tax return and no information returns, 
family income is coded as zero.
In the population-based sample, we define 
parent income as mean family income over 
the 5 years when the child is 15–19 years old. 
In the SOI sample, parent income is observed 
only in the year that the child is linked to the 
parent, and therefore we define parent income as 
family income in that year. In both samples, we 
drop observations with zero or negative parent 
income.
We define child family income in the same 
way as parent income, always using data from 
the population files. We define a child’s college 
attendance as an indicator for having a 1098-T 
form in the calendar year the child turns 19.

TRENDS IN INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY
Because 1098-T forms are filed directly by col-
leges, we have records on college attendance for 
all children.
III.  Results
Rank-Rank Specification.—We begin by 
measuring intergenerational mobility using a 
­rank-rank specification. We rank each child rela-
tive to others in her birth cohort based on her 
mean family income at ages 29–30. Similarly, 
we rank parents relative to other parents of 
children in the same birth cohort based on their 
family incomes.1 We then study the relationship 
between child and parent ranks. In our compan-
ion paper on the geography of mobility (Chetty 
et al. 2014a; henceforth CHKS), we show that 
such rank-rank specifications provide a more 
robust summary of intergenerational mobility 
than traditional log-log specifications.
Figure 1 plots the average income rank of chil-
dren (at ages 29–30) versus parent income rank 
for three sets of birth cohorts in the SOI sam-
1 In the SOI sample, we always define parent and child 
ranks within each birth cohort and SOI cross section year. 
We use sampling weights when constructing the percentiles 
so that they correspond to positions in the population. 
ple: 1971–1974, 1975–1978, and 1979–1982. 
To reduce noise, we divide parent income ranks 
into 50 (rather than 100) bins and plot the mean 
child rank versus the mean parent rank within 
each bin. The rank-rank relationship is almost 
perfectly linear. Its slope can be interpreted as 
the difference in the mean percentile rank of 
children from the richest families versus chil-
dren from the poorest families. The rank-rank 
slopes for the three sets of cohorts in Figure 1 
(estimated using OLS on the binned data) are 
all approximately 0.30, with standard errors 
less than 0.01. In the working paper version, we 
show that these rank-rank slope estimates are 
robust to measuring parent and child income at 
different ages and using multiple years to mea-
sure income, indicating that the estimates do not 
suffer from significant life cycle or attenuation 
bias.
Trends in Income Mobility.—Figure 2 pres-
ents our primary estimates of intergenerational 
mobility by birth cohort (see online Appendix 
Table 1 for the data plotted in this figure). 
The series in solid circles plots estimates of the 
rank-rank slope for the 1971–1982 birth cohorts 
using the SOI sample. Each estimate is based 
on an OLS regression of child rank on parent 
rank for the relevant cohort, weighted using 
inverse sampling probabilities. Consistent with 
Figure 1, there is no trend in these rank-rank 
slopes. We also find that log-log IGE estimates 
are stable or, if anything, falling slightly over 
time (online Appendix Table 1).2
We cannot measure children’s income at 
age 30 beyond the 1982 birth cohort because 
our data end in 2012. To characterize mobil-
ity for younger cohorts, we repeat the preced-
ing analysis using income measures at age 26. 
The series in squares in Figure 2 plots the 
rank-rank slope based on child income at 
age 26 for the 1980–1986 birth cohorts in the 
­population-based sample. Once again, there is 
no trend in this series. Moreover, there is much 
2 The log-log IGE is stable because, as we show below, 
the marginal distributions of parent and child incomes have 
expanded at roughly similar rates. Formally, if parent and 
child incomes have a Bivariate Lognormal distribution 
and the standard deviations of parent and child log income 
increase by the same percentage over time, stability of the 
rank-rank slope implies stability of the log-log IGE.

Notes: The figure plots the mean percentile income rank 
of children at ages 29–30 (y-axis) versus the percentile 
rank of their parents (x-axis) for three groups of cohorts 
(1971–1974, 1975–1978, and 1979–1982) in the SOI sam-
ple. The figure is constructed by binning parent rank into 
2-percentile point bins (so that there are 50 equal-width 
bins) and plotting the mean child rank in each bin versus the 
mean parent rank in each bin. Estimates from OLS regres-
sions on the binned data are reported for each cohort group, 
with standard errors in parentheses.

less fluctuation across cohorts because the esti-
mates are more precise in the population data.
Importantly, CHKS show that intergenera-
tional mobility estimates based on income at age 
26 and age 30 are highly correlated across areas 
within the United States. Hence, even though the 
level of the rank-rank slopes at age 26 is slightly 
lower than the estimates at age 30, we expect 
trends in mobility based on income at age 26 to 
provide a reliable prediction of trends in mobil-
ity at age 30.
Trends in College Gradients.—For children 
born after 1986, many of whom have not yet 
entered the labor market, we measure intergen-
erational mobility based on college attendance. 
Naturally, college is a strong predictor of earn-
ings. Moreover, CHKS demonstrate that the 
correlation between college attendance rates 
and parent income is a strong predictor of dif-
ferences in intergenerational income mobility 
across areas within the United States.
The relationship between college attendance 
rates and parent income ranks is approximately 
linear, as shown in the working paper ver-
sion of this study. We therefore summarize the 
association between parent income and college 
attendance by regressing an indicator for being 
enrolled in college at age 19 on parent income 
rank. The coefficient in this regression, which 
we term the college attendance gradient, can 
be interpreted as the gap in college attendance 
rates between children from the lowest- and 
highest-income families. The series in triangles 
in Figure 2 plots the college attendance gradi-
ent for the 1984–1993 birth cohorts. The gap 
in college attendance rates between children 
from the lowest- and highest-income families is 
essentially constant at 74.5 percent between the 
1984–1989 birth cohorts. The gap falls slightly 
in the most recent cohorts, reaching 69.2 percent 
for the 1993 cohort. In the working paper ver-
sion, we show that results are very similar when 
measuring college attendance at later ages. 
We also show that intergenerational mobility is 
stable (or improving slightly) when we analyze 
the correlation between parent income and the 
quality of the colleges their children attend, as 
measured by the earnings of prior graduates.
Our estimates of the college attendance gra-
dient for the 1984 cohort are consistent with 
Bailey and Dynarski’s (2011) estimates for 
the 1979–1982 cohorts in survey data. Bailey 
and Dynarski show that the college attendance 
gradient grew between the 1961–1964 and 
1979–1982 birth cohorts; our data show that the 
college attendance gradient has stabilized more 
recently.
Consolidated Series.—We construct a con-
solidated series of intergenerational mobility for 
the 1971–1993 birth cohorts by combining the 
age 29–30 income gradient (online Appendix 
Table 1, column 5), the age 26 income gradient 
(column 7), and the college attendance gradient 
(column 8). To do so, we multiply the age 26 
income gradient by a constant scaling factor of 
1.12 to match the level of the age 29–30 income 
gradient for the 1980–1982 cohorts, when both 
measures are available. Similarly, we multiply 
the college gradients by a scaling factor of 0.40 
to match the rescaled age 26 income gradients

cates the series in squares for the 1984–1993 birth cohorts, 
changing the dependent variable to an indicator for college 
attendance at age 19. The series in open circles represents

from 1984–1986. The series in circles in Figure 2 
presents the resulting consolidated series from 
1971–1993. The solid circles are simply the esti-
mates based on age 29–30 income; the open cir-
cles are forecasts based on age 26 income for the 
1983–1986 cohorts and college attendance for 
the 1987–1993 cohorts. This consolidated series 
provides a forecast of intergenerational income 
mobility at age 30 for recent cohorts under the 
assumption that the college and age 26 income 
gradients are always a constant multiple of the 
age 30 income gradient.
The consolidated series is virtually flat. 
The estimated trend based on an OLS regression 
using the 23 observations in this series is −0.0006 
per year and the upper bound of the 95 percent 
confidence interval is 0.0008. This implies that 
intergenerational persistence of income ranks 
increased by at most 0.0008/0.3 = 0.27 per-
cent per year between the 1971 and 1993 birth 
cohorts.3
Transition Matrices.—As a supplement to the 
rank-rank correlation, Figure 3 plots children’s 
probabilities of reaching the top income quin-
tile of their cohort conditional on their parents’ 
income quintile. We define quintiles by ranking 
children relative to others in their birth cohort 
and parents relative to other parents of children 
in the same birth cohort. Children’s incomes are 
measured at age 26. The series in circles use 
the SOI sample, while those in triangles use the 
population-based sample. All the series exhibit 
little or no trend. For instance, the probability 
of reaching the top quintile conditional on com-
ing from the bottom quintile of parental income 
is 8.4 percent in 1971 and 9 percent in 1986. 
Measuring child income at age 29–30 yields 
similar results (online Appendix Table 4).
Regional Differences.—The trends in mobil-
ity are small especially in comparison to the 
variation across areas within the United States. 
Using data for the 1980–1985 cohorts, CHKS 
show that the probability that a child rises from 
the bottom to the top quintile is 4 percent in 
some parts of the Southeast but over 12 percent 
in other regions, such as the Mountain states. 
3 Online Appendix Table 3 replicates this analysis cutting 
the sample by the child’s gender. We find no trend in mobil-
ity for males or females. 
In Figure 4, we assess whether these differ-
ences across areas persist over time. This figure 
plots the age 26 income rank-rank slopes and 
college attendance gradients by birth cohort for 
selected Census divisions (see online Appendix 
Table 5 for estimates for all Census divisions). 
We assign children to Census divisions based 
on where their parents lived when they claimed 
them as dependents and continue to rank both 
children and parents in the national income 
distribution.
The gradients are quite stable: they are con-
sistently highest in the Southeast and lowest 
in the Mountain and Pacific states, with New 
England in the middle. There are, however, 
some modest differential trends across areas. 
For example, the age 26 income rank-rank slope 
fell from 0.326 to 0.307 from the 1980–1986 
birth cohorts in the Southeast, but increased 
from 0.244 to 0.267 in New England. Studying 
such differential trends may be a fruitful path 
to understanding the causal determinants of 
mobility. To facilitate such work, we have pub-
licly posted intergenerational mobility esti-
mates by commuting zone for the 1980–1993 
birth cohorts in online Data Table 1.

Changes 
in 
Marginal 
Distributions.— 
Consistent with prior research, we find that 
inequality amongst both parents and chil-
dren—as measured by Gini coefficients and top 
1 percent income shares—has increased signif-
icantly in our sample (online Appendix Table 6). 
The increase in the Gini coefficient for parents 
in the bottom 99 percent of the distribution 
almost exactly matches the increase observed 
in the Current Population Survey, as shown 
in Appendix A of the working paper. Hence, 
existing estimates of changes in marginal 
income distributions can be combined with 
the rank-based estimates of mobility presented 
here to construct various mobility statistics of 
interest.
IV.  Discussion
Putting together our results with evidence 
from Lee and Solon (2009) that intergen-
erational elasticities of income did not change 
significantly between the 1950 and 1970 birth 
cohorts, we conclude that rank-based mea-
sures of social mobility have remained stable 
over the second half of the twentieth century 
in the United States. The key issue in our view 
is not that mobility is declining but rather that 
some regions of the United States persistently 
offer less mobility than most other developed 
countries.
The lack of a trend in intergenerational 
mobility contrasts with the increase in income 
inequality in recent decades. This contrast may 
be surprising given the well-known negative 
correlation between inequality and mobil-
ity across countries (Corak 2013). Based on 
this “Great Gatsby curve,” Krueger (2012) 
predicted that recent increases in inequality 
would increase the intergenerational persis-
tence of income by 20 percent in the United 
States. One explanation for why this predic-
tion was not borne out is that much of the 
increase in inequality has been driven by the 
extreme upper tail (Piketty and Saez 2003). 
In CHKS, we show that there is little correla-
tion between mobility and extreme upper tail 
inequality—as measured e.g., by top 1 per-
cent income shares—both across countries and 
across areas within the United States. Instead, 
the correlation between inequality and mobility 
is driven primarily by “middle class” inequal-
ity, which can be measured for example by the 
Gini coefficient among the bottom 99 percent. 
Based on CHKS’ estimate of the correlation 
between the bottom 99 percent Gini coefficient 
and intergenerational mobility across areas, 
we would expect the correlation of parent and 
child income ranks to have increased by only 
7.5 percent (from 0.30 to 0.323) from the 1971 
to 1993 birth cohorts (see the working paper 
for details). From this perspective, it is less sur-
prising that mobility has not changed signifi-
cantly despite the rise in inequality.
The stability of intergenerational mobility 
is perhaps more surprising given that socio-
economic gaps in early indicators of success 
such as test scores, parental inputs, and social 
connectedness have grown over time (Putnam, 
Frederick, and Snellman 2012). Based on such 
evidence, Putnam, Frederick, and Snellman pre-
dicted that the “adolescents of the 1990s and 
2000s are yet to show up in standard studies 
of intergenerational mobility, but the fact that 
working class youth are relatively more discon-
nected from social institutions, and increasingly 
so, suggests that mobility is poised to plunge 
dramatically.” An important question for future

4 There is a strong cross-sectional correlation across areas 
of the United States between intergenerational mobility and 
measures of social capital, family structure, and test scores 
(CHKS), making the lack of a time series relationship more 
surprising. One potential explanation is that other counter-
vailing trends—such as improved civil rights for minorities 
or greater access to higher education—have offset these 
forces.
