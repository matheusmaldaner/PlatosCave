‘Ergodicity Economics’ is Pseudoscience

(Dated: June 7, 2023)
In a series of papers [1–4], Ole Peters and his collaborators claim that the ‘conceptual basis of
mainstream economic theory’ is ‘ﬂawed’ and that the approach they call ‘ergodicity economics’ gives
‘reason to hope for a future economic science that is more parsimonious, conceptually clearer and
less subjective’ [4]. This paper argues that ‘ergodicity economics’ is pseudoscience because it has
not produced falsiﬁable implications and should be taken with skepticism.

INTRODUCTION
In a series of papers including ones that are published
in prestigious physics journals, Ole Peters and his collab-
orators claim that the ‘conceptual basis of mainstream
economic theory’ is ‘ﬂawed’ and that the approach they
call ‘ergodicity economics’ gives ‘reason to hope for a fu-
ture economic science that is more parsimonious, concep-
tually clearer and less subjective’ [1–4]. In The Logic of
Scientiﬁc Discovery, Popper [5, p. 18] suggests that fal-
siﬁability should be taken as a criterion of demarcation
between science and non-science. The Wikipedia article1
deﬁnes pseudoscience as “statements, beliefs, or practices
that claim to be both scientiﬁc and factual but are in-
compatible with the scientiﬁc method”. The page lists
the following indicators of possible pseudoscience: (i) use
of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims, (ii) improper
collection of evidence, (iii) lack of openness to testing by
other experts, (iv) absence of progress, (v) personaliza-
tion of issues, and (vi) use of misleading language. This
paper argues that ‘ergodicity economics’ advanced by Pe-
ters and collaborators is pseudoscience because (i) it has
so far produced few testable implications and therefore is
not falsiﬁable, and (ii) it meets many indicators of pseu-
doscience.

‘ERGODICITY ECONOMICS’
Henceforth we shall refer to ‘ergodicity economics’ as
EE. It is not easy to deﬁne what EE is because I am not
an expert on this ﬁeld (I am an expert on mathemati-
cal economics,2 which could be considered ‘mainstream
economic theory’). Here, to avoid unnecessary debates,
we shall focus on what is claimed in Peters [4], which

is published in Nature Physics and is one of the most
inﬂuential work of Peters by citation counts.3 It is not
clear what kind of economic questions the author is try-
ing to address (because the problem is never deﬁned), but
based on the discussion in the section titled “A modern
treatment asking the ergodicity question”, it seems that
he is studying ﬁnancial decisions under uncertainty, as he
writes “[r]eal-life ﬁnancial decisions usually come with a
degree of uncertainty” and “[g]rowth rate optimization is
now sometimes called ‘ergodicity economics’” (p. 1218).
He also writes “the geometric mean [. . . ] is well known
among gamblers as Kelly’s criterion of 1956. Our modest
contribution is to frame these observations as a question
of ergodicity”, citing [6]. Based on this reading, I inter-
pret that EE prescribes “growth rate optimization”, that
is, maximizing the geometric growth rate of an invest-
ment.4
III.
AN OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO PROBLEM
To contrast EE and the ‘mainstream economic theory’
(expected utility theory, henceforth EUT5) criticized in
[1–4], let us consider the following problem studied by
Merton [8] and Peters [1].
A.
Model
There are two assets, risky (say a stock mutual fund)
and safe (say a money market fund). An investor chooses
a portfolio (proportion of money invested in each asset).
What is the optimal portfolio? This problem seems to
3 As of the time of writing, it is cited 154 times.
4 The idea of “growth rate optimization” dates back at least to [7]
and certainly before the treatment of optimal investment in a
dynamic setting based on expected utility theory [8, 9].
5 EUT was axiomatized by von Neumann and Morgenstern [10];
see their Section 1.3, and also [11, Ch. 8] for a textbook treat-
ment. Although there are diverse views among economists re-
garding the theory of decision under uncertainty, most would
agree that EUT is a useful benchmark.
See [11, Part III] for
models other than EUT.

be fundamental for personal ﬁnance, and any theory of
investment ought to provide some prescription. To make
the problem concrete, suppose that the price St of the
risky asset evolves according to a geometric Brownian
motion with drift µ > 0 and volatility σ > 0, so the
instantaneous net return6 is
dSt
St
= µdt + σdBt,
(1)
where Bt is a standard Brownian motion.7 Thus, µ is
the expected return. Suppose that the safe asset yields
a risk-free return 0 < r < µ. Suppose that at t = 0, an
investor with wealth normalized to 1 invests a fraction
of wealth θ in the risky asset and the remaining fraction
1 −θ in the safe asset.8 Although inessential, to make
matters simple, suppose the portfolio θ is chosen once
and for all and that it will be continuously rebalanced to
keep this fraction. Then the investor’s wealth at time Wt
evolves according to the geometric Brownian motion
dWt
Wt
= θdSt
St
+ (1 −θ)rdt
= (r + (µ −r)θ)dt + σθdBt.
(2)
Finally, suppose the investor cares only about the termi-
nal wealth WT , where T > 0 is the investment horizon.
Applying Itô’s lemma to (2), log wealth evolves according
to the Brownian motion
d log Wt = (r + (µ −r)θ −σ2θ2/2)dt + σθdBt.
(3)
Using the well-known property of the Brownian motion,
the terminal wealth WT is lognormally distributed:
log WT ∼N((r + (µ −r)θ −σ2θ2/2)T, σ2θ2T ).
(4)
B.
Prescription of ‘ergodicity economics’
EE prescribes to maximize the long run geometric av-
erage growth rate.
Because we normalized the initial
wealth to 1, the geometric average growth rate is simply
W 1/T
T
. Its logarithm is therefore normally distributed as
1
T log WT ∼N(r + (µ −r)θ −σ2θ2/2, σ2θ2/T ).
(5)
6 To be clear with technical terms, if an investment is multiplied
by 1.1, we say that the gross return is 1.1. The net return is 0.1
or 10%. The log return is log 1.1 = 0.0953.
7 Some authors use Wt or W (t) to denote the Brownian motion
(Wiener process) but I use the notation Bt (which is equally
common) because I will later use Wt to denote wealth. As Pe-
ters [1] rightly points out in a footnote, “[s]ome authors deﬁne
the parameters of geometric Brownian motion diﬀerently [. . . ]
notation must be carefully translated for comparisons”.
8 In the two-asset case, θ can be interpreted as the leverage.
I
refer to θ as “portfolio” because it has the natural generalization
to multiple assets.
Note that the mean of the log geometric average growth
rate (the arithmetic average log growth rate) (5) is con-
stant at
r + (µ −r)θ −1
2σ2θ2,
(6)
and the standard deviation σθ/
√
T tends to 0 as the
investment horizon T tends to inﬁnity.
Therefore as
T →∞, the log geometric average growth rate converges
(in probability) to the mean (6). EE thus prescribes to
maximize (6), and because the objective function is a con-
cave quadratic function, the optimal portfolio is clearly
θ = µ−r
σ2 . This solution was given by Peters [1, Equation
(23)], though this type of reasoning goes back at least to
Latané [7].
C.
Prescription of ‘mainstream economic theory’
In
contrast,
the
‘mainstream
economic
theory’
approach—expected utility theory (EUT)—prescribes
that
the
investor
maximizes
the
expected
utility
E[u(WT )],9
where
u
is
called
a
von
Neumann-
Morgenstern utility function. The most commonly used
utility function is the constant relative risk aversion
(CRRA) utility function u(x) = x1−γ
1−γ , where 0 < γ ̸= 1 is
called the relative risk aversion coeﬃcient [12]. The case
γ = 1 corresponds to log utility u(x) = log x. Using the
property of the moment generating function of the nor-
mal distribution, for γ ̸= 1 a straightforward calculation
yields
U(θ) = E[u(WT )]
=
1
1 −γ exp

(1 −γ)

r + (µ −r)θ −1
2σ2θ2

+1
2(1 −γ)2σ2θ2

T

.
A monotonic transformation yields
V (θ) =
1
T (1 −γ) log((1 −γ)U(θ))
= r + (µ −r)θ −1
2γσ2θ2.
(7)
If γ = 1, a similar calculation yields the identical ob-
jective function (7). Since V (θ) is a concave quadratic
function of θ, the maximum is achieved when θ = µ−r
γσ2 .
This solution was given by Merton [8, Equation (25)].10
9 This statement is an oversimpliﬁcation of EUT. Economists have
studied many other generalizations, for instance allowing for
consumption in intermediate periods, non-independent and non-
Gaussian returns, and portfolio adjustment over time.
10 The notation is slightly diﬀerent. Our µ, γ correspond to Merton
[8]’s α, 1 −γ but this is inessential.

IV.
IS ‘ERGODICITY ECONOMICS’
TESTABLE?
Obviously, the objective functions of EE (6) and EUT
(7) agree (for this particular optimal portfolio problem)
when γ = 1, so both theories make identical predictions
in that particular case. Some economists have criticized
the ‘growth optimal’ approach (maximizing the long run
geometric average) because it is consistent with expected
utility maximization only in the special case of logarith-
mic utility [13, 14].11 That critique is valid conditional on
accepting expected utility theory, but is obviously uncon-
vincing to those who rejects EUT in the ﬁrst place. Oth-
ers have criticized EE for misunderstanding EUT [15, 16].
Here I criticize EE from a diﬀerent point of view. If
EE is a science, according to Popper [5] it must pro-
vide testable implications: the theory must be falsiﬁable.
The optimal portfolio problem described above is one
testable implication: in principle, we can gather data on
the model parameters µ, r, σ and check whether investors
choose the portfolio θ = µ−r
σ2
prescribed by ‘growth rate
optimization’ of EE. Similarly, EUT is testable by per-
haps conducting experiments in which we vary the model
parameters µ, r, σ2 and check whether the chosen port-
folio is proportional to µ−r
σ2
(only proportional, because
the relative risk aversion coeﬃcient is not directly ob-
servable).
What if we consider a diﬀerent problem? Suppose an
investor lives for three periods denoted by t = 0, 1, 2,
which could be interpreted as the young age, middle age,
and retirement.
The (non-ﬁnancial) income of the in-
vestor at time t is denoted by Yt (which could be a ran-
dom variable). There could be two (risky and riskless) as-
sets as before; the gross return of the risky asset between
time t −1 and t is denoted by Rt, and the gross risk-free
rate is Rf. The investor could also choose consumption
Ct.
Then the problem is to choose the consumption-
investment plan (Ct, θt) satisfying the dynamic budget
constraints
Wt+1 = (Rf + (Rt+1 −Rf)θt)(Wt −Ct + Yt)
for t = 0, 1 given W0 = 0. EUT (or I should just say
‘economic theory’ because it does not need to be ex-
pected utility theory) has a prescription for this optimal
11 Interestingly, Peters [1] cites Merton and Samuelson [14] out of
context in a sentence discussing the “advantage of [maximized
time-average growth rate]” (p. 1601). In fact, [14] is quite crit-
ical to “growth rate optimization”, writing (p. 69) “Recourse to
the Law of Large Numbers, as applied to repeated multiplica-
tive variates (cumulative sums of logarithms of portfolio value
relatives), has independently tempted various writers, holding
out to them the hope that one can replace an arbitrary util-
ity function of terminal wealth with all its intractability, by the
function U(WT ) = log WT : maximizing the geometric mean or
the expected log of outcomes, it was hoped, would provide an
asymptotically exact criterion for rational action”.
consumption-portfolio problem. Any ﬁrst year PhD stu-
dent in economics will be able to formulate the problem
mathematically. Given the assumption (or data) on the
utility function, income process, and the return process, a
suﬃciently competent PhD student will be able to solve
the model numerically and compare the model predic-
tions to the data. If the 3-period problem is unrealistic,
no problem; it could be 30 period or inﬁnite horizon or
whatever. My point is that given the assumptions we
make, economic theory will provide a testable implica-
tion that is in principle falsiﬁable, and therefore it is a
science.
I wonder what EE (growth rate optimization) has to
say about this simple model of consumption and invest-
ment. Peters and Gell-Mann [3] note that “[a] generaliza-
tion beyond purely additive or multiplicative dynamics is
possible, just as it is possible to deﬁne utility functions
other than the linear or logarithmic function. This will be
the subject of a future publication”. I am looking forward
to seeing how EE would solve the above consumption-
investment problem, though I am not optimistic as it
has been 12 years since [1] was published and we have not
seen much progress (and the result in [1] is itself a minor
reformulation of [6, 7]). Until EE provides testable im-
plications, we should stay away from it as pseudoscience.
V.
INDICATORS OF PSEUDOSCIENCE
Let us return to Wikipedia’s indicators of pseudo-
science discussed in the introduction. Many of them ap-
ply to EE.
(i) Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims
Pe-
ters and Gell-Mann [3] make the grandiose claim “[t]he
concepts we have presented resolve the fundamental
problem of decision theory, therefore game theory, and
asset pricing” without presenting any concrete applica-
tion or potentially testable implication.
(ii) Improper collection of evidence
The only experi-
mental evidence Peters [4] cites is Meder et al. [17], which
has also been criticized [15]. Peters [1] cites Merton and
Samuelson [14] out of context.
Peters [1] states “[i]n
economics, a mistaken belief in ergodicity has produced
widespread conceptual inconsistency” citing the review
article [18], though nowhere in that article such a state-
ment can be found.
(iii) Lack of openness to testing by other experts
As
of the time of writing, Peters lists 34 research papers
listed on his webpage.12 Among them, 22 are published
and 12 are unpublished working papers. Among the 22
published papers, only three are published in journals
remotely related to economics (one in Decision Analy-
sis, one in Quantitative Finance, and one in Journal of
Income Distribution). Thus, despite the label ‘ergodic
economics’, it is not reviewed by experts in economics.

(iv) Absence of progress
Peters often cites only very
old works such as Huygens, Bernoulli, Kelly [6], and
Samuelson [9]. EE does not seem to add anything new
beyond [6].
(v) Personalization of issues
Peters and Gell-Mann
[3] criticize with unnecessarily strong language: “Menger
did decision theory a crucial disservice by undoing
Laplace’s correction, adding further errors, and writing
a persuasive but invalid paper on the subject that con-
cluded incorrectly”.
(vi) Use of misleading language
The abstract of Pe-
ters [4] states “Economics typically deals with systems far
from equilibrium—speciﬁcally with models of growth. It
may therefore come as a surprise to learn that the pre-
vailing formulations of economic theory—expected util-
ity theory and its descendants—make an indiscriminate
assumption of ergodicity”.
Here it is unclear what is
meant by “equilibrium” (there are many general equilib-
rium models of growth in economics) and what “indis-
criminate assumption of ergodicity” refers to.
VI.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Physicists and economists have a long history of inter-
action. Walras and Pareto, who have made fundamental
contributions to economics, were also trained in physics
and engineering. The ﬁrst Yale economics PhD, Irving
Fisher (1891), was a student of the physicist Willard
Gibbs.
More recently, since the late 1990s, there was
a fruitful interaction between physicists and economists
for studying the power law behavior [19–22].
I myself
have modest contributions published in physics journals
[23, 24] and acknowledge physicists’ contributions to eco-
nomics [25].
I appreciate the open-mindedness of physicists and wel-
come their perspectives on economic phenomena. How-
ever, I must express my concerns about a few researchers
who lack proper training in the subject matter and at-
tack economics based on ignorance and misunderstand-
ing.
Even more concerning is that some of them, like
Peters, have used popular and social media to dissemi-
nate pseudoscientiﬁc information [26–29]. We should all
follow scientiﬁc methods, and I hope that scientiﬁc jour-
nals can maintain the integrity of peer review.
