The fading American dream:
Trends in absolute income
mobility since 1940

We estimated rates of “absolute income mobility”—the fraction of children who earn more
than their parents—by combining data from U.S. Census and Current Population Survey
cross sections with panel data from de-identified tax records. We found that rates of
absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children born in 1940 to 50% for
children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone
cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s.
However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940
birth cohort would reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that
reviving the “American dream” of high rates of absolute mobility would require economic
growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.
O
ne of the defining features of the “Ameri-
can dream” is the aspiration that children
have a higher standard of living than their
parents (1). When children are asked to as-
sess their economic progress, they frequently
compare their own standard of living to that of
their parents (2, 3). Such measures of “absolute
income mobility”—the fraction of children earn-
ing or consuming more than their parents—
are also often the focus of policy-makers when
judging the degree of economic opportunity
in the United States (4).
Despite longstanding interest in the topic, em-
pirical evidence concerning absolute income mo-
bility remains scarce, mainly because of the lack
of large, high-quality panel data sets linking chil-
dren to their parents in the United States (5).
Some studies have used panel surveys such as the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics to measure the
level of absolute income mobility for recent U.S.
cohorts (6–9). These studies have produced con-
flicting results because estimates of absolute mo-
bility using available panel income data sets are
sensitive to econometric assumptions and sample
specification (5). Moreover, to the best of our knowl-
edge, there is no evidence on trends in absolute
income mobility, although prior work has docu-
mented declining absolute mobility in terms of
occupational status (10) and educational attain-
ment (11).
Here, we developed a new method of estimat-
ing rates of absolute mobility that can be im-
plemented with existing data sets covering the
1940 to 1984 birth cohorts. Our approach com-
bines two inputs: (i) marginal income distributions
for parents and children, and (ii) the copula of
the parent and child income distribution, defined
as the joint distribution of parent and child in-
come ranks.
We used cross-sectional data from the decen-
nial U.S. Census and Current Population Surveys
(CPS) to estimate marginal income distributions
for children in the 1940 to 1984 birth cohorts and
their parents. The census data sets cover between
1% and 5% of the U.S. population, yielding samples
of 20,000 to 35,000 families per cohort, whereas
the CPS samples include approximately 1500 to
3000 people per cohort. In our baseline analysis,
we measured income in pretax dollars at the house-
hold level when parents and children were about
30 years old, which we refer to as the amount of
income “earned” by parents and children for con-
venience. We adjusted for inflation using the Con-
sumer Price Index Research Series (CPI-U-RS).
Finally, we ensured that our results are robust to
a variety of alternative specification choices, such
as using different inflation adjustments, adjusting
for taxes and transfers, measuring income at later
ages, and measuring income at the individual
rather than family level.
We estimated the fraction of children who earn
more than their parents in each birth cohort by
combining the marginal income distributions with
the copula in each cohort. For children born in
or after 1980, we followed Chetty et al. (12) and
directly estimated the joint distribution of pa-
rent and child ranks, using information from de-
identified federal income tax returns covering more
than 10 million parent-child pairs. For cohorts
born before 1980, such population-level panel data
are not available. We addressed this missing data
problem in two ways. First, we determined esti-
mates of absolute mobility under the assumption
that the copula remained stable across all birth
cohorts, a benchmark motivated by evidence of
copula stability (i.e., stable relative mobility) since
the 1970s (13–15). Because we have no evidence
that the copula was in fact stable prior to 1970,
we additionally constructed upper and lower
bounds on absolute mobility for each birth cohort
by using linear programming methods to search
over all plausible copulas (16). Our key technical
result is that these bounds are very tight for the
1940 to 1950 birth cohorts, allowing us to obtain
a reliable time series on rates of absolute mobility
despite the lack of historical panel data.
Using this methodology, we found that rates
of absolute upward income mobility in the United
States have fallen sharply since 1940. Under the
benchmark of copula stability, the fraction of chil-
dren earning more than their parents fell from
92% in the 1940 birth cohort to 50% in the 1984
birth cohort. Relaxing the copula stability assump-
tion for earlier cohorts, we found that the rate
of absolute mobility for the 1940 birth cohort is
bounded between 84% and 98% across all plausible
copulas, well above the rates observed for recent
cohorts. Thus, the key piece of missing data that
has hampered direct measurement of absolute
mobility—the lack of historical panel data linking
parents and children—turns out to be inessential
for characterizing trends in mobility.
Why have rates of upward income mobility
fallen so sharply over the past half century? There
have been two important macroeconomic trends
that have affected the incomes of children born
in the 1980s relative to those born in the 1940s:
lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates
and greater inequality in the distribution of growth
(17). We considered two counterfactual scenar-
ios to assess the relative contribution of these
two factors.
First, we considered a “higher GDP growth”
scenario, in which children in the 1980 cohort
experience GDP growth from birth to age 30 that
is comparable to what was experienced by the
1940 cohort, but GDP is distributed in proportion
to GDP shares by income percentile in 2010. In
this scenario, absolute mobility rises to 62%. Sec-
ond, we considered a “more broadly shared growth”
scenario, in which the actual GDP in 2010 is allo-
cated across income percentiles as it was in the
1940 cohort. In this scenario, the rate of absolute
mobility rises to 80%. Together, these simulations
show that increasing GDP growth without chang-
ing the current distribution of growth would have
modest effects on rates of absolute mobility. Un-
der the current distribution of GDP, we would
need real GDP growth rates above 6% per year
to return to the rates of absolute mobility seen in
the 1940s. Intuitively, because a large fraction
of GDP goes to a small number of high income
earners today, higher GDP growth does not sub-
stantially increase the number of children who
earn more than their parents. Hence, reviving

the “American dream” of high rates of absolute
mobility would require more broadly shared
economic growth rather than just higher GDP
growth rates.
Methods and data
Let yk
ic denote the income of child i in birth co-
hort c, and let yp
ic denote the income of his or
her parents. In our baseline analysis, we measure
income as pretax family income (summing income
across spouses) at age 30. We measure incomes in
2014 dollars, adjusting for inflation using the CPI-
U-RS. In sensitivity analyses (discussed below), we
consider several variants of this income concept:
using alternative price deflators, measuring income
at age 40, measuring income after taxes and trans-
fers, and adjusting for family size.
We define the rate of absolute mobility in co-
hort c, Ac, as the fraction of children in cohort c
that earn weakly more than their parents:
Ac ¼ 1
Nc
X
i
1fyk
ic ≥yp
icg
ð1Þ
where Nc is the number of children in the cohort.
We estimate Ac by decomposing the joint dis-
tribution of parent and child income into the
marginal distributions of parent and child income
and the joint distribution of the ranks (the cop-
ula). Let r k
ic denote the percentile rank of child i
in the income distribution for children in birth
cohort c. Similarly, let r p
ic denote the percentile
rank of child i’s parent in the income distri-
bution of parents who have children in cohort c.
The joint distribution of parent and child ranks
for cohort c is given by Cc(rk, rp), the probability
density function of observing a child with income
rank rk and parent income rank rp. Let Q k
c ðrÞ
and Q p
c ðrÞ denote the rth quantile of the child
and parent income distributions (measured in
dollars), respectively. Q k
c ðrÞ and Q p
c ðrÞ summa-
rize the marginal distributions of parent and child
incomes. With this notation, we can write absolute
mobility as
Ac ¼ ∫1fQk
c ðrkÞ ≥Qp
c ðrpÞgCcðrk; rpÞdrkdrp ð2Þ
Intuitively, a child with rank rk earns weakly more
than her parent with rank rp if the rkth quantile
of the child’s income distribution is weakly higher
than the rpth quantile of the parent’s income dis-
tribution; that is, Qk
c ðrkÞ≥Qp
c ðrpÞ. The copula,
Cc(rk, rp), measures the probability that each
pair of ranks (r k, r p) occurs. Absolute mobility
is the fraction of cases where Qk
c ðrkÞ≥Qp
c ðrpÞ,
integrating over the copula.
Equation 2 shows that absolute mobility can
be calculated by estimating (i) the marginal in-
come distribution for children (which yields Qk
c ),
(ii) the marginal income distributions for parents
(which yields Qp
c ), and (iii) the copula, Cc(rk, rp).
We next describe how we estimate these three
distributions (see the supplementary materials for
details).
Children’s marginal income distributions
We obtained marginal income distributions at
age 30 for children in the 1940 to 1984 birth
cohorts directly from the CPS March 1970 to
March 2014 samples. The sample of children
includes U.S.-born members of the 1940 to 1984
birth cohorts who, at age 30, were present in the
U.S. and not institutionalized. We exclude immi-
grants in order to have a consistent sample in
which we observe both parents’ and children’s
incomes (18, 19). We compute family income as
the sum of spouses’ personal pretax income.
Parents’ marginal income distributions
Estimating the income distributions of parents
at age 30 who have children in a given birth co-
hort is more complicated because of the lack of
historical panel data. We construct parents’ in-
come distributions for children in each of the
1940 to 1984 birth cohorts by pooling data from
census cross sections between 1940 and 2000,
using the 1% IPUMS samples (20). We restrict
our attention to individuals who have children
between the ages of 16 and 45. To cover all par-
ents via decennial censuses, we estimate parents’
incomes when the highest earner is between the
ages of 25 and 35, a symmetric window around
age 30.
For example, we estimate the income distri-
bution of parents of children in the 1970 birth
cohort as follows. First, we use the 1970 census
and select parents between the ages of 25 and
35 who have a child less than 1 year old in 1970.
Next, we turn to the 1980 census and select par-
ents between the ages of 26 and 35 who have 10-
year-old children (i.e., individuals who had a
child in 1970 when they were between the ages
of 16 and 25). Third, to identify parents between
ages 35 and 45 who had children less than 1 year
old in 1970, we turn to the 1960 census and select
all individuals aged 25 to 35. We give this group a
weight equal to the fraction of individuals in the
1970 census between the ages of 35 and 45 who
had a child less than 1 year old in 1970. This ap-
proach assumes that the income distribution of
those who have children after age 35 is repre-
sentative of the income distribution of the general
population. Such an assumption is unavoidable,
as one cannot identify parents who will have
children in the future in cross-sectional data.
Fortunately, this assumption turns out to be in-
consequential in practice because most children
are born before their parents are 35. In the sup-
plementary materials, we show that restricting at-
tention to parents who have children between the
ages of 25 and 35, thereby avoiding this assump-
tion entirely, yields very similar results.
We estimate income distributions for parents
with children in each of the other birth cohorts
from 1940 to 1984 using an analogous approach.
Summary statistics on parents’ and children’s in-
comes by birth cohort are reported in table S1.
Copula
For children born in the 1980s, we estimate a non-
parametric copula—a 100 × 100 matrix giving
the probability of each child and parent rank
pair (r k, rp)—exactly as in Chetty et al. (12). The
sample includes all children born in 1980, 1981,
or 1982 who are linked to parents according to
dependent claiming on tax forms.
For both parents and children, we define fam-
ily income in the tax records in a manner that is
as similar as possible to the measures in the CPS
and census. For those who file tax returns, we de-
fine income as adjusted gross income (AGI) plus
the nontaxable portion of two types of income
distributed by the U.S. Social Security Adminis-
tration: Supplemental Security Income and So-
cial Security Disability Income. For nonfilers, we
measure income using third-party information
returns, defining income as the sum of the W-2
wage earnings, Supplemental Security Income,
Social Security Disability Income, and unemploy-
ment insurance income. If individuals do not file
a tax return and have no information returns filed
on their behalf, taxable income is coded as zero.
Following (12), we measure children’s incomes
as mean income in 2011 and 2012, when children
in the 1980 to 1982 birth cohorts are between the
ages of 30 and 32. We measure parents’ incomes
as mean taxable income between 1996 and 2000,
the first 5 years in which population tax records
are available. Parents are between the ages of 30
and 60 when we measure their incomes because
we limit the sample to parents who have children
between the ages of 15 and 40 during 1980–1982.
Chetty et al. (12) showed that the distribution of
income ranks is stable between the ages of 30 and
60. Because of this rank stability, this approach
provides an accurate estimate of the copula that
one would obtain if one could observe income
ranks at age 30 for all parents.
We exclude parents with zero or negative in-
come when constructing the copula because par-
ents with no earnings typically do not file a tax
return and hence cannot be linked to their chil-
dren on the basis of dependent claiming. This
does not pose a problem for measuring absolute
mobility because children whose parents have zero
income always earn at least as much as their pa-
rents. We calculate the fraction of parents with
zero income in each cohort based on census data
and include these individuals when computing
average rates of absolute mobility, assigning the
group of children whose parents have zero income
an absolute mobility rate of 100%.
We define children’s percentile ranks rk
ic based
on their incomes relative to other children in
their birth cohort. We include children with zero
income when constructing these ranks by defin-
ing their ranks as the fraction of children with
zero income divided by 2; for instance, if 10% of
children have zero income, all children with zero
income would be assigned a percentile rank of 5.
Likewise, parents are assigned percentile ranks
based on their incomes relative to other parents
(among those with positive income). The copula
is then estimated as a 100 × 100 matrix that gives
the joint probability of each child and parent rank
pair (rk, rp).
For children born before 1980, we lack the
panel data necessary to estimate the copula.

Income panel to show that the copula (relative
mobility, measured by percentile ranks) is ap-
proximately stable from the 1971 birth cohort to
the 1984 birth cohort. Motivated by this result,
we begin by assuming copula stability across all
cohorts since 1940, applying the copula estimated
for the 1980 to 1982 cohorts to all cohorts. We
then compute bounds on absolute mobility search-
ing over alternative copulas, as there is no em-
pirical evidence that copula stability holds going
back to 1940.
The statistics we construct on absolute mo-
bility by birth cohort, parent percentile, state, and
gender can be downloaded from www.equality-of-
opportunity.org.
Baseline estimates
Our baseline estimates of absolute mobility as-
sume copula stability from 1940 to 1984 and mea-
sure family income in real pretax dollars at age 30.
Figure 1A plots rates of absolute mobility by parent
income percentile for the decadal birth cohorts,
1940 to 1980. Each series shows the percentage
of children earning more than their parents versus
their parents’ income percentile, limiting the sam-
ple to parents with positive income.
In the 1940 birth cohort, nearly all children
grew up to earn more than their parents, re-
gardless of their parents’ income. Naturally, rates
of absolute mobility were lower at the highest
parent income levels, as children have less scope
to do better than their parents if their parents
had very high incomes.
Rates of absolute mobility have fallen substan-
tially since 1940, especially for families in the mid-
dle and upper class. At the 10th percentile of
the parent income distribution, children born in
1940 had a 94% chance of earning more than
their parents, compared with 70% for children
born in 1980. At the 50th percentile, rates of ab-
solute mobility fell from 93% for children born
in 1940 to 45% for those born in 1980. And at
the 90th percentile, rates of absolute mobility
fell from 88% to 33% over the same period.
Figure 1B aggregates the rates of absolute mo-
bility across parent incomes (including those with
zero income) and plots average absolute mobility
(Ac) for each birth cohort from 1940 to 1984. Ab-
solute mobility declined starkly across birth co-
horts: On average, 92% of children born in 1940
grew up to earn more than their parents. In con-
trast, only 50% of children born in 1984 grew up
to earn more than their parents. The downward
trend in absolute mobility was especially sharp
between the 1940 and 1964 cohorts. The decline
paused for children born in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, whose incomes at age 30 were mea-
sured in the midst of the economic boom of the
late 1990s. Absolute mobility then continued to
fall steadily in the remaining birth cohorts.
Bounds under alternative copulas
We now assess the sensitivity of the estimates
reported in Fig. 1 to the assumption that the cop-
ula remained stable at the values observed for the
1980 birth cohort going back to 1940. We do so by
deriving bounds on the rate of absolute mobility
in each birth cohort, searching over all copulas
Cc(r k, r p), defined nonparametrically by a 100
× 100 percentile-level matrix.
We restrict our attention to copulas satisfying
the intuitive requirement that children from higher-
income families are less likely to have lower in-
comes (relative to children from lower-income
families). Formally, we assume that the income
distribution of children with higher-income par-
ents first-order stochastically dominates (FOSD)
the income distribution of children from lower-
income families:
∫
rk
0 Ccðr; rpÞdr is weakly decreasing in rp for all rk
ð3Þ
For each birth cohort, we calculate bounds on ab-
solute mobility by solving for the copulas Cc(rk, rp)
that minimize and maximize Ac, as defined in
Eq. 2, given the empirically observed marginal
distributions, Qk
c ðrkÞ and Qp
c ðrpÞ. We impose
two sets of constraints on this problem: (i) the
FOSD requirements for each (rk, rp) pair in Eq. 3,
and (ii) integration constraints requiring that each
of the columns and rows of Cc(rk, rp) sum to 1.
This optimization problem has 100 × 100 = 10,000
arguments, which might appear to be computa-
tionally intractable. Fortunately, because the ob-
jective function in Eq. 2 and all the constraints
are linear, this problem can be solved rapidly
with a standard linear programming algorithm.
The results of this bounding exercise are
presented in Fig. 2A. The series in circles repro-
duces the baseline estimates under the assump-
tion of copula stability shown in Fig. 1B. The
dashed lines show the upper and lower bounds
on absolute mobility. The bounds are very tight
in early cohorts but grow much wider for more
recent cohorts. For example, for the 1940 birth
cohort, the bounds on absolute mobility span
only 84% to 98%. In contrast, for the 1984 birth
cohort, the bounds span 14% to 88%.
The dashed vertical line in Fig. 2A demarcates
the point after which the copula is known to be
stable, based on the analysis of tax records in (15).

B) The fraction of children earning more than their parents (“absolute
mobility”) by parent income percentile for selected child birth cohorts (A)
and on average by child birth cohort (B). Only parents with positive income
are included in (A); within this group, parent income percentiles are con-
structed according to their ranks in the distribution of parents’ incomes within
each child cohort. Parents with zero income are included in (B), defining
absolute mobility as 100% for that subgroup when computing the mean rate
of absolute mobility by cohort. Child income is measured at age 30 in the
CPS March supplement as the sum of individual and spousal income,
excluding immigrants after 1994. Parent income is measured in the census
as the sum of the spouses’ incomes for families in which the highest
earner is between ages 25 and 35. Children’s and parents’ incomes are
measured in real 2014 dollars using the CPI-U-RS. Absolute mobility is
calculated by combining these income distributions with the copula
estimated for the 1980 to 1982 cohorts in tax data by (12).

estimate the copula happen to be available for
precisely the cohorts where the bounds are least
informative. For earlier cohorts, where the neces-
sary data to estimate the copula are missing, the
bounds are quite narrow and the copula there-
fore proves to be unimportant. The upshot of Fig.
2A is that even though we cannot identify the
copula in early cohorts, we can be certain that
absolute mobility has declined sharply since
the 1940s.
We now consider why the bounds are tight
in the 1940 and 1950 cohorts but grow wider in
more recent cohorts. Figure 2B plots the marginal
distribution of income for children in the 1940
birth cohort and their parents. Income grew very
rapidly across all quantiles of the income distri-
bution between 1940 and 1970. As a result, there
is very little overlap between the income distri-
butions of children born in 1940 and their parents.
For example, a child born to parents at the 80th
percentile of the parent income distribution needed
to reach just the 14th percentile of the child income
distribution to exceed his or her parents’ income.
In the extreme case in which the distribution of
child income lies everywhere above the distribu-
tion of parent income (i.e., the poorest child earns
more than the richest parent), absolute mobility
would be 100%, irrespective of which children are
linked to which parents. Although the 1940 parent
and child income distributions are not fully sep-
arated, we show below that they are sufficiently
close to this scenario to render the copula un-
important for calculating absolute mobility.
In contrast, recent cohorts experienced much
less growth across most quantiles of the income
distribution (17, 21). Figure 2C illustrates this
point by replicating Fig. 2B for the 1980 birth
cohort. Because growth rates were much lower
between 1980 and 2010, there is substantial over-
lap between parents’ and children’s income distri-
butions (at age 30) for children born in 1980.
Children with parents at the 80th percentile of
the income distribution now need to reach the
74th percentile of their cohort’s income distribution
to earn more than their parents.
Figure 2D shows why the greater degree of
overlap between children’s and parents’ income
distributions in recent cohorts leads to wider
bounds on absolute mobility. The curves in this
figure plot the income rank a child must reach
to earn more than his or her parents as a func-
tion of the parents’ income percentile, separately
for the 1940 and 1980 birth cohorts. For exam-
ple, to earn more than parents at the 80th per-
centile, children need to reach the 14th percentile
in the 1940 cohort and the 74th percentile in the
1980 cohort, as shown in Fig. 2, B and C.

The bounds are estimated separately by cohort. Solid circles replicate the base-
line estimates shown in Fig. 1B, with the section to the right of the dashed vertical
line corresponding to the cohorts (1971 to 1984) for which copula stability is
documented in (15). (B) Plot of the marginal family income distributions of
children in the 1940 birth cohort and their parents, measured at approximately
age 30. Corresponding to the analysis in Fig. 1A, parents with zero income are
excluded, but children with zero income are included when estimating these
kernel densities. For scaling purposes, incomes above $200,000 are excluded.
(C) Plot of analogous income distributions for children in the 1980 birth cohort

order to earn more than his or her parents for the 1940 and 1980 cohorts,

in (B) and (C). Also shown is a heat map of the baseline copula for the 1980 to
1982 birth cohorts. The copula is a 100 × 100 matrix where each cell (x, y)
gives the probability of a child being in income percentile y and having parents
in income percentile x (conditional on parents having positive income). Darker
colors represent areas with higher density in the copula.

The copula can be visualized in Fig. 2D as the
distribution of mass within the (r k, r p) square.
Absolute mobility Ac can be calculated by sum-
ming the mass in the copula that lies above the
relevant curve. The empirically observed copula
for the 1980 to 1982 cohorts used in our baseline
analysis is shown by the shading in the figure,
with darker colors representing areas with higher
density. The mass is clustered around the diag-
onal, reflecting positive intergenerational per-
sistence of income. Absolute mobility is 50% for
the 1980 cohort because half of the mass of this
copula lies above the curve plotted for the 1980
cohort.
Our bounding procedure minimizes and max-
imizes the amount of mass in the copula that
falls above the curves in Fig. 2D, subject to the
FOSD and integration constraints specified above.
Because the child rank required to surpass par-
ents is very close to the 45° line for the 1980
cohort, rates of absolute mobility are very sen-
sitive to whether the mass in the copula lies just
above or just below the diagonal. This shows
why we obtain wide bounds when searching
over all copulas for the 1980 cohort. In contrast,
because the child rank required to earn more
than parents is very low at nearly all percentiles
of the parent income distribution for the 1940
cohort, all feasible copulas generate high levels
of absolute mobility for that cohort.
Sensitivity and heterogeneity analysis
In this section, we first assess the sensitivity of
our baseline estimates to key specification choices,
such as the price deflator and definition of income.
We then examine heterogeneity in trends in ab-
solute mobility across subgroups.
Sensitivity analysis
We begin by considering alternative price de-
flators. Several studies have noted that the CPI-
U-RS may overstate inflation by failing to account

subtracting 0.8% from the annual inflation rate implied by the CPI-U-RS
(24, 25). (B) Estimates using income after including federal taxes and trans-

1960 and historical marginal tax rates for years before 1960.Transfers include
cash and in-kind transfers. Cash transfers are obtained from census and CPS
data; in-kind transfers are obtained from calculations in (40) using CPS data
from calendar year 1967 onward (for years before 1967, in-kind transfers are
set to zero). (C) Plot of absolute mobility when child income is measured
at age 40 and parent income is measured between ages 35 and 45. Note
that the last year of income data in our sample is 2014, so absolute mo-
bility can be measured at age 40 only until the 1974 birth cohort. (D) Esti-
mates that adjust income for family size and number of earners. In the series
in open circles, we divide the baseline measures of family income by the
square root of family size (defined as the number of dependent children plus
the number of adults) for both parents and children. In the series in triangles,
we estimate the fraction of sons whose individual incomes are greater than
or equal to their fathers’ individual incomes. Individual income is defined in
the same way as the baseline family income measure but does not include
spousal income.

adequately for improvements in product quality
and the introduction of new goods (22, 23). Prior
work on the measurement of trends in poverty
recommends subtracting 0.8 percentage points
from the annual inflation rate implied by the CPI-
U-RS to account for such biases (24, 25). The
series in squares in Fig. 3A replicates the base-
line series on absolute mobility by cohort in Fig. 1B
using this adjusted price index. As expected, this
adjustment increases absolute mobility in recent
cohorts, as it increases real income growth rates
across the distribution. However, the magnitude
of the change is small: With the adjusted series,
absolute mobility falls from 93% in 1940 to 59%
in the 1984 cohort. Even subtracting 2 percentage
points from the inflation rate implied by the CPI-
U-RS—a conservative adjustment larger than vir-
tually all existing estimates of the bias due to new
goods—still results in a 26–percentage point decline
in absolute mobility from 1940 to 1984 (fig. S2A).
We also consider a variety of other commonly
used price indices: (i) the personal consumption
expenditure price index (PCEPI), an index that
includes a broader bundle of goods than the CPI;
(ii) the producer price index (PPI), an index con-
structed from prices at the producer level; (iii)
the GDP deflator, an index that covers all goods
used domestically; and (iv) the CPI-U series that
is most commonly used to measure inflation (26).
All of these alternative indices produce time series
of absolute mobility very similar to our baseline
estimates (Fig. 3A and fig. S2A).
Our baseline analysis uses pretax measures
of earnings rather than net income after taxes
and transfers. Conceptually, it is not clear which
of these income definitions provides a better
measure of absolute mobility, as individuals’
sense of progress might differ if they achieve
upward mobility through government transfers
rather than their own earnings. We assess whether
the distinction matters empirically in Fig. 3B by
replicating our baseline analysis using post-tax
and transfer incomes. We estimate tax liabilities
for parents and children using the National Bureau
of Economic Research (NBER) TAXSIM model,
which is available for years after 1960. Before
1960, we use data on federal marginal tax rates,
adjusted for personal exemptions by marital status
and number of children (27). We estimate the
value of transfers as the sum of Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, General Assistance, Sup-
plemental Security Income, and the cash value
of in-kind transfers. Accounting for taxes and
transfers increases the level of absolute mobility
by around 3 percentage points in all cohorts but
does not affect the trend in absolute mobility
appreciably. This is because taxes and transfers
affect the incomes of both parents and their chil-
dren and because tax and transfer changes typ-
ically affect the tails of the income distribution,
where incremental changes in income have smaller
effects on absolute mobility because children are
either already earning more than their parents
or have fallen far short of that threshold.
In our baseline analysis, we measure children’s
incomes at age 30. One may be concerned that
children take a longer time to reach peak life-
cycle earnings in more recent cohorts, which could
lead to a spurious downward trend in rates of
absolute mobility. Figure 3C addresses this con-
cern by replicating our baseline analysis measur-
ing income at age 40 for children (for the 1940
to 1974 cohorts) and at ages 35 to 45 for parents.
This series continues to exhibit a sharp decline
in absolute mobility across birth cohorts. The time
pattern of the decline is shifted backward by ap-
proximately 10 years, consistent with measuring
incomes 10 years later.
The fraction of individuals who are married
at age 30 and the size of families have both fallen
steadily in recent decades (28). One widely used
approach to adjusting for changes in household
size is to divide family income by the square root
of the number of family members in the house-
hold (29). Figure 3D shows that when we divide
our baseline income measures by the square root
of family size, rates of absolute mobility fall from
93% in 1940 to 60% in 1984 (30). As an alter-
native approach, one can measure income at the
individual rather than household level. The series
in triangles in Fig. 3D compares the individual
earnings of sons to their fathers, as in prior studies
of intergenerational mobility (13). Here, we find
a steeper decline in absolute mobility than in our
baseline specification: The fraction of sons earning
more than their fathers fell from 95% in 1940 to
41% in 1984. Together, these results show that
accounting for trends in family size and the number
of earners does not affect the qualitative conclusion
that absolute mobility has fallen substantially.
Combining the preceding adjustments by (i)
measuring income at age 30 after taxes and trans-
fers, (ii) dividing income by the square root of
family size, and (iii) subtracting 0.8 percentage
points from the CPI-U-RS when adjusting for in-
flation continues to yield qualitatively similar re-
sults. In this specification, absolute mobility falls
from 96% to 72% between the 1940 cohort and the
1984 cohort (fig. S3).
Beyond the specific factors considered above,
one may be concerned that levels of absolute mo-
bility for recent cohorts may still be understated
because of increases in fringe benefits, nonmarket
goods, or underreporting of income in the CPS
(31, 32). As an omnibus approach to assessing the
potential bias from such factors, we recalculate
absolute mobility for the 1984 birth cohort after
increasing each child’s income by various fixed
dollar amounts. Adding $1000 to every child’s in-
come in 2014 would increase absolute mobility
for the 1984 cohort to 51% from the baseline esti-
mate of 50%; adding $10,000 would increase
absolute mobility to only 61% (fig. S4). These cal-
culations show that plausible adjustments to chil-
dren’s incomes are unlikely to change the conclusion
that absolute mobility has fallen sharply from the
rates of 80 to 90% experienced by children born
in the 1940s and 1950s.
In our baseline analysis, we define absolute
mobility using a discrete measure of whether chil-
dren earn more than their parents. Using other
thresholds (e.g., the fraction of children earning

20% more or less than their parents) or a more
continuous definition of absolute mobility—the
median ratio of child to parent income—yields
very similar results (fig. S5).
Finally, in figs. S6 to S9, we show that the re-
sults are also robust to a set of other technical
issues that arise from data limitations: (i) adjusting
forchanges in the definition of family income across
censuses; (ii) including immigrants in all years to
account for missing data on immigrant status in
early cohorts; (iii) using a single census to measure
parents’ income instead of pooling data across
multiple censuses; and (iv) using data from either
the census or CPS to measure the incomes of both
parents and children from a single data set.
Heterogeneity analysis
Next, we examine how trends in absolute mo-
bility vary across subgroups. We begin by ex-
amining heterogeneity across states. We define
parents’ states as based on where they live when
we measure their incomes (between ages 25 and
35). We define children’s state as their state of
birth to account for the possibility that children
who grow up in a given state may move elsewhere
as adults. Because children’s state of birth is not
observed in the CPS, we use the census for both
parents and children (33).
Figure 4 presents the results by state, showing
absolute mobility by cohort for selected states
(Fig. 4A; see table S2 for estimates for all states)
and a map of the change in absolute mobility
from 1940 to 1980 by state (Fig. 4B). Absolute
mobility fell substantially in all 50 states be-
tween the 1940 and 1980 birth cohorts. Absolute
mobility fell particularly sharply in the industrial
Midwest, where rates of absolute mobility fell
by 48 percentage points in Michigan and about
45 percentage points in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio.
The smallest declines occurred in states such as
Massachusetts, New York, and Montana, where
absolute mobility fell by about 35 percentage
points.
Next, we examine heterogeneity by gender.
When comparing children’s family incomes to
their parents’ family incomes as in our baseline
analysis, we find similar declines in absolute mo-
bility for sons and daughters (fig. S10). However,
the patterns differ by gender when we focus on
individual earnings. As noted above, sons’ chances
of earning more than their fathers fell steeply,
from 95% in 1940 to 41% in 1984, underscoring
the sharp decline in the economic prospects of
American men. In contrast, the fraction of daugh-
ters earning more than their fathers fell from
43% for the 1940 birth cohort to 22% in 1960, and
then rose slightly to 26% in 1984. The pattern for
women’s individual earnings differs because of
the rise in female labor force participation rates
and earnings over the period we study (fig. S11).
In sum, the subgroup analysis shows that de-
clines in absolute mobility have been a systematic,
widespread phenomenon throughout the United
States since 1940 (34).
Counterfactual scenarios
Why have rates of absolute income mobility fallen
so sharply over the last half century, and what
policies can restore absolute mobility to earlier
levels? We used simulations to evaluate the effects
of two key trends over the past half century:
declining rates of GDP growth and greater in-
equality in the distribution of GDP (17, 35).
We considered two counterfactual scenarios.
The first, a “higher GDP growth” scenario, asks
what would have happened to absolute mobil-
ity for the 1980 cohort if the economy had
grown as quickly during their lifetimes as it did
in the mid–20th century, but with GDP dis-
tributed across households as it is today. The
second “more broadly shared growth” scenario
asks the converse: What if total GDP grew at the
rate observed in recent decades, but GDP was
allocated across households as it was for the
1940 birth cohort? The first scenario expands
the size of the economic pie, dividing it into
the proportions by which it is divided today. The
second keeps the size of the pie fixed but divides
it more evenly, as in the past. We define house-
holds’ income shares as a fraction of GDP rather
than total labor income in order to characterize
what would have happened to absolute mobility
had the total output of the economy been dis-
tributed as in the past, accounting for changes
in the distribution of labor income as well as
changes in the share of GDP going to labor.
We calculate children’s counterfactual incomes
under the higher GDP growth scenario as follows.
Let GO
t denote the observed GDP per working-
age family in year t, where “working-age” families
are families with at least one member between
the ages of 18 and 64. We first define the share
of GDP that goes to children at percentile q of
the 1980 cohort in 2010 as pk

the 1980 cohort would have experienced if GDP per working-age family had

resulting higher level of GDP in 2010 is allocated to households according to the
ratio of income to GDP per working family at each percentile of the family income
distribution for 30-year-olds in 2010. The series “1980 GDP/family growth rate
(1.5%), 1940 income shares” plots the rates of absolute mobility that the 1980
cohort would have experienced if GDP in 2010 had been allocated in the same
manner across households as it was for the 1940 cohort. For each series, we also
report the mean level of absolute mobility (AM), averaging across all income
percentiles (including parents with zero incomes, whose children mechanically
have absolute mobility of 100% and are not shown in the figure). (B) Plot of mean

parable to the real growth rate per working-
age family from 1940 to 1970, and is 1 percentage
point per year higher than the actual annualized
growth rate from 1980 to 2010 of 1.5% (36). Fi-
nally, we define a counterfactual marginal income

by the level of GDP that would have prevailed in
2010 had children in the 1980 cohort experienced
GDP growth from birth to age 30 comparable to
that experienced by children born in the 1940s.
For the “more broadly shared growth” sce-

This counterfactual represents the incomes 30-year-

tions as in 1970.

copula and parent marginal income distributions
as above to compute counterfactual rates of ab-
solute mobility by parent income percentile.
Figure 5A presents the results. The top and bot-
tom curves in the figure reproduce the empir-
ical series for the 1940 and 1980 cohorts from
Fig. 1A. The dotted and dashed series show
absolute mobility rates that would have been
observed for the 1980 cohort under the counter-
factuals in Eqs. 4 and 5.
Under the higher-growth counterfactual, the
mean rate of absolute mobility is 62%. This rate
is 12 percentage points higher than the empir-
ically observed value of 50% in 1980, but closes
only 29% of the decline relative to the 92% rate
of absolute mobility in the 1940 cohort. The in-
crease in absolute mobility is especially mod-
est, given the magnitude of the change in the
aggregate economy: A growth rate of 2.5% per
working-age family from 1980 to 2010 would
have led to GDP of $20 trillion in 2010, $5
trillion (35%) higher than the actual level.
The more broadly shared growth scenario
increases the average rate of absolute mobility
to 80%, closing 71% of the gap in absolute mo-
bility between the 1940 and 1980 cohorts. The
broadly shared growth counterfactual has larger
effects on absolute mobility at the bottom of the
income distribution, whereas the higher-growth
counterfactual has larger effects at higher income
levels. Because income shares of GDP are larger
for high-income individuals, higher growth rates
benefit those with higher incomes the most,
whereas a more equal distribution benefits those
at the bottom the most.
The results in Fig. 5A imply that much of the
decline in absolute mobility is due to changes in
the distribution of growth rather than reductions
in aggregate growth rates. In Fig. 5B, we ask what
rates of GDP growth would be necessary to return
to mid-century rates of absolute mobility under
today’s income distribution. We plot mean rates
of upward mobility under real GDP per family
growth rates from 1% to 10%, recalculating GC
2010
and using Eq. 4 to generate counterfactual income
distributions. Achieving rates of absolute mobility
above 80% under today’s income distribution
would require sustained real per-family growth
greater than 5% per year (or total real GDP growth
above 6.4%), well above the historical experience of
the United States since the Second World War.
Higher GDP growth rates do not substantially
increase the number of children who earn more
than their parents because a large fraction of GDP
goes to a small number of high income earners
today. To see why absolute mobility is insensitive
to the growth rate when growth is distributed
unequally, consider the extreme case in which
one child obtains all of the increase in GDP. In
this case, higher GDP growth rates would have no
effect on absolute mobility. More generally, GDP
growth has larger effects on absolute mobility
when growth is spread more broadly, allowing
more children to achieve higher living standards
than their parents. Higher GDP growth and a
broader distribution of growth have a multiplica-
tive effect on absolute mobility: Absolute mobility
is highest when GDP growth rates are high and
growth is spread broadly across the distribution.
In the supplementary materials, we show that
similar results are obtained when using counter-
factuals for the change in incomes from 1980 to
2010 based on shares of GDP growth over that
period rather than counterfactuals for the level of
incomes in 2010. Measuring incomes at age 40
instead of 30 also yields similar results (fig. S12).
In sum, the counterfactuals show that higher
growth rates alone are insufficient to restore ab-
solute mobility to the levels observed in mid-
century America. A broader distribution of income
growth is necessary to revive absolute mobility,
and can itself be sufficient to reverse much of the
decline since 1940 even if growth were to remain
at current levels (37, 38).
Conclusion
Our analysis yields two main results. First, chil-
dren’s prospects of earning more than their par-
ents have faded over the past half-century in
the United States. The fraction of children earn-
ing more than their parents fell from approxi-
mately 90% for children born in 1940 to around
50% for children entering the labor market today.
Absolute income mobility has fallen across the
entire income distribution, with the largest de-
clines for families in the middle class. These find-
ings contrast with prior research showing that
relative mobility—measured, for instance, by the cor-
relation between parents’ and children’s incomes—
remained stable in recent decades (13, 15). The
measures of absolute mobility we focus on in
this study differ from relative mobility because they
compare levels of earnings across generations by
bringing in data on the marginal income distri-
butions of parents and children. Absolute mobil-
ity has fallen over time while relative mobility
has remained stable because income growth has
stagnated across much of the income distribution
in recent decades.
Second, most of the decline in absolute mo-
bility is driven by the more unequal distribution
of economic growth in recent decades, rather
than by the slowdown in GDP growth rates. In
this sense, the rise in inequality and the decline
in absolute mobility are closely linked. Growth
is an important driver of absolute mobility, but
high levels of absolute mobility require broad-
based growth across the income distribution.
With the current distribution of income, higher
GDP growth rates alone are insufficient to re-
store absolute mobility to the levels experienced
by children in the 1940s and 1950s. If one wants
to revive the “American dream” of high rates of
absolute mobility, then one must have an interest
in growth that is spread more broadly across the
income distribution.

16. We define the set of “plausible” copulas as copulas under
which the distribution of children’s incomes is weakly
increasing with their parents’ incomes (in the sense of first-
order stochastic dominance). This restriction rules out
perverse copulas that generate negative intergenerational
income persistence.

18. The CPS did not ask for respondents’ birthplace prior to 1994;
hence, for children born before 1964, we cannot exclude
immigrants from the sample. Most of the growth in the foreign-
born share of the population occurred in recent decades,
limiting the bias created by the inclusion of immigrants in early
cohorts (19). Moreover, because immigrants’ earnings are
lower than natives’ earnings on average, this bias likely
reduces our estimates of absolute mobility in the early cohorts,
rendering our estimate of the amount of decline more
conservative.

20. The measures of total pretax income available in the census
change over time. From 1970 onward, we use the sum of
spouses’ personal pretax income minus income from public
assistance. In 1960, we use the sum of spouses’ personal
pretax income. In 1950, we use total family income. In 1940,
only income from wages and salaries is available, along with an
indicator for nonwage, nonsalary income, which we use to
impute nonwage income. See supplementary materials for
further details.

33. To increase precision, our state-level analysis includes all
children aged 25 to 35 and uses the 100% census in 1940 and
5% IPUMS sample in 1980. Measuring children’s incomes from
ages 25 to 35, rather than just at age 30, creates small
differences in levels of absolute mobility. To adjust for these
differences, we calculate the difference between the baseline
national estimates and population-weighted national means of
our state-level estimates for each cohort, and add these
differences to the state-level estimates.
34. We cannot examine heterogeneity in absolute mobility by race
because race is not observed in the tax data we use to
construct the copula.

36. The 1.5% growth rate of GDP per working-age family
corresponds to total real GDP growth of 2.8% per year,
whereas the 2.5% growth rate of GDP per working-age
family corresponds to total real GDP growth of 3.8%
per year.
37. Plausible changes in relative mobility (the copula)
also have modest effects on average rates of
absolute mobility. For example, a uniform
copula—where children’s ranks are independent
of their parents’ ranks—would still produce absolute
upward mobility for the 1980 cohort of 50%. Greater
relative mobility produces higher rates of absolute
mobility for children with low-income parents while
reducing rates of absolute mobility for children with
high-income parents, leaving average absolute mobility
essentially unchanged.
