We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million
children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mo-
bility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of
parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of
child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10
percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase

in a child’s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially
across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a
child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting
from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San
Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mo-
bility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii)
better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stabil-
ity. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms
that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on interge-
nerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.

I. Introduction
The United States is often hailed as the ‘‘land of opportu-
nity,’’ a society in which a person’s chances of success depend
little on his or her family background. Is this reputation war-
ranted? We show that this question does not have a clear
answer because there is substantial variation in intergenera-
tional mobility across areas within the United States. The
United States is better described as a collection of societies,
some of which are ‘‘lands of opportunity’’ with high rates of mo-
bility across generations, and others in which few children escape
poverty.
We characterize intergenerational mobility using informa-
tion from deidentiﬁed federal income tax records, which provide
data on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their
parents between 1996 and 2012. We organize our analysis into
three parts.
In the ﬁrst part, we present new statistics on intergenera-
tional mobility in the United States as a whole. In our baseline
analysis, we focus on U.S. citizens in the 1980–1982 birth co-
horts—the oldest children in our data for whom we can reliably
identify parents based on information on dependent claiming. We
measure these children’s income as mean total family income
in 2011 and 2012, when they are approximately 30 years old.
We measure their parents’ income as mean family income be-
tween 1996 and 2000, when the children are between the ages
of 15 and 20.1
1. We show that our baseline measures do not suffer from signiﬁcant life cycle
or attenuation bias (Solon 1992; Zimmerman 1992; Mazumder 2005) by establish-
ing that estimates of mobility stabilize by the time children reach age 30 and are not
very sensitive to the number of years used to measure parent income.

Following the prior literature (e.g., Solon 1999), we begin
by estimating the intergenerational elasticity of income (IGE)
by
regressing
log
child
income
on
log
parent
income.
Unfortunately, we ﬁnd that this canonical log-log speciﬁcation
yields very unstable estimates of mobility because the relation-
ship between log child income and log parent income is nonlinear
and the estimates are sensitive to the treatment of children with
zero or very small incomes. When restricting the sample between
the 10th and 90th percentiles of the parent income distribution
and excluding children with zero income, we obtain an IGE esti-
mate of 0.45. However, alternative speciﬁcations yield IGEs rang-
ing from 0.26 to 0.70, spanning most of the estimates in the prior
literature.2
To obtain a more stable summary of intergenerational mobil-
ity, we use a rank-rank speciﬁcation similar to that used by Dahl
and DeLeire (2008). We rank children based on their incomes
relative to other children in the same birth cohort. We rank par-
ents of these children based on their incomes relative to other
parents with children in these birth cohorts. We characterize mo-
bility based on the slope of this rank-rank relationship, which
identiﬁes the correlation between children’s and parents’ posi-
tions in the income distribution.3
We ﬁnd that the relationship between mean child ranks and
parent ranks is almost perfectly linear and highly robust to al-
ternative speciﬁcations. A 10 percentile point increase in parent
rank is associated with a 3.41 percentile increase in a child’s
income rank on average. Children’s college attendance and teen-
age birth rates are also linearly related to parent income ranks. A
10 percentile point increase in parent income is associated with a
6.7 percentage point (pp) increase in college attendance rates and
a 3 pp reduction in teenage birth rates for women.
In the second part of the article, we characterize variation in
intergenerational mobility across commuting zones (CZs). Com-
muting zones are geographical aggregations of counties that are
similar to metro areas but cover the entire United States,
2. In an important recent study, Mitnik et al. (2014) propose a new dollar-
weighted measure of the IGE and show that it yields more stable estimates. We
discuss the differences between the new measure of mobility proposed by Mitnik et
al. and the canonical deﬁnition of the IGE in Section IV.A.
3. The rank-rank slope and IGE both measure the degree to which differences
in children’s incomes are determined by their parents’ incomes. We discuss the
conceptual differences between the two measures in Section II.

including rural areas (Tolbert and Sizer 1996). We assign chil-
dren to CZs based on where they lived at age 16—that is, where
they grew up—irrespective of whether they left that CZ after-
ward. When analyzing CZs, we continue to rank both children
and parents based on their positions in the national income dis-
tribution, which allows us to measure children’s absolute out-
comes as we discuss later.
The relationship between mean child ranks and parent ranks
is almost perfectly linear within CZs, allowing us to summarize
the conditional expectation of a child’s rank given his parents’
rank with just two parameters: a slope and intercept. The slope
measures relative mobility: the difference in outcomes between
children from top versus bottom income families within a CZ. The
intercept measures the expected rank for children from families
at the bottom of the income distribution. Combining the intercept
and slope for a CZ, we can calculate the expected rank of children
from families at any given percentile p of the national parent
income distribution. We call this measure absolute mobility at
percentile p. Measuring absolute mobility is valuable because in-
creases in relative mobility have ambiguous normative implica-
tions, as they may be driven by worse outcomes for the rich rather
than better outcomes for the poor.
We ﬁnd substantial variation in both relative and absolute
mobility across CZs. Relative mobility is lowest for children who
grew up in the Southeast and highest in the Mountain West and
the rural Midwest. Some CZs in the United States have relative
mobility comparable to the highest mobility countries in the
world, such as Canada and Denmark, while others have lower
levels of mobility than any developed country for which data
are available.
We ﬁnd similar geographical variation in absolute mobility.
We focus much of our analysis on absolute mobility at p ¼ 25,
which we call ‘‘absolute upward mobility.’’ This statistic measures
the mean income rank of children with parents in the bottom half
of the income distribution given linearity of the rank-rank rela-
tionship. Absolute upward mobility ranges from 35.8 in Charlotte
to 46.2 in Salt Lake City among the 50 largest CZs. A 1 standard
deviation increase in CZ-level upward mobility is associated with
a 0.2 standard deviation improvement in a child’s expected rank
given parents at p ¼ 25, 60% as large as the effect of a 1 standard
deviation increase in his own parents’ income. Other measures of
upward mobility exhibit similar spatial variation. For instance,

the probability that a child reaches the top ﬁfth of the income
distribution conditional on having parents in the bottom ﬁfth is
4.4% in Charlotte, compared with 10.8% in Salt Lake City and
12.9% in San Jose. The CZ-level mobility statistics are robust to
adjusting for differences in the local cost of living, shocks to local
growth, and using alternative measures of income.
Absolute upward mobility is highly correlated with relative
mobility: areas with high levels of relative mobility (low rank-
rank slopes) tend to have better outcomes for children from low-
income families. On average, children from families below
percentile p ¼ 85 have better outcomes when relative mobility is
greater; those above p ¼ 85 have worse outcomes. Location mat-
ters more for children growing up in low-income families: the ex-
pected rank of children from low-income families varies more
across CZs than the expected rank of children from high income
families.
The spatial patterns of the gradients of college attendance
and teenage birthrates with respect to parent income across CZs
are very similar to the variation in intergenerational income mo-
bility. This suggests that the spatial differences in mobility are
driven by factors that affect children while they are growing up
rather than after they enter labor market.
In the ﬁnal part of the article, we explore such factors by
correlating the spatial variation in mobility with observable char-
acteristics. To begin, we show that upward income mobility is
signiﬁcantly lower in areas with larger African American popu-
lations. However, white individuals in areas with large African
American populations also have lower rates of upward mobility,
implying that racial shares matter at the community level.
We then identify ﬁve factors that are strongly correlated with
the variation in upward mobility across areas. The ﬁrst is segre-
gation: areas that are more residentially segregated by race and
income have lower levels of mobility. Second, areas with more
inequality as measured by Gini coefﬁcients have less mobility,
consistent with the ‘‘Great Gatsby curve’’ documented across
countries (Krueger 2012; Corak 2013). Top 1% income shares
are not highly correlated with intergenerational mobility both
across CZs within the United States and across countries, sug-
gesting that the factors that erode the middle class may hamper
intergenerational mobility more than the factors that lead to
income growth in the upper tail. Third, proxies for the quality
of the K-12 school system are positively correlated with mobility.

Fourth, social capital indexes (Putnam 1995)—which are proxies
for the strength of social networks and community involvement in
an area—are also positively correlated with mobility. Finally,
mobility is signiﬁcantly lower in areas with weaker family struc-
tures, as measured, for example, by the fraction of single parents.
As with race, parents’ marital status does not matter purely
through its effects at the individual level. Children of married
parents also have higher rates of upward mobility in communities
with fewer single parents. Interestingly, we ﬁnd no correlation
between racial shares and upward mobility once we control for
the fraction of single parents in an area.
We ﬁnd modest correlations between upward mobility and
local tax policies and no systematic correlation between mobility
and local labor market conditions, rates of migration, or access to
higher education. In a multivariable regression, the ﬁve key fac-
tors described above generally remain statistically signiﬁcant
predictors of both relative and absolute upward mobility, even
in speciﬁcations with state ﬁxed effects. However, we emphasize
that these factors should not be interpreted as causal determi-
nants of mobility because all of these variables are endogenously
determined and our analysis does not control for numerous other
unobserved differences across areas.
Our results build on an extensive literature on intergenera-
tional mobility, reviewed by Solon (1999) and Black and Devereux
(2011). Our estimates of the level of mobility in the United States
as a whole are broadly consistent with prior results, with the
exception of Mazumder’s (2005) and Clark’s (2014) IGE esti-
mates, which imply much lower levels of intergenerational mo-
bility. We discuss why our ﬁndings may differ from their results
in Online Appendices D and E. Our focus on within-country com-
parisons offers two advantages over the cross-country compari-
sons that have been the focus of prior comparative work (e.g.,
Bjorklund and Ja¨ntti 1997; Ja¨ntti et al. 2006; Corak 2013).
First, differences in measurement and methods make it difﬁcult
to reach deﬁnitive conclusions from cross-country comparisons
(Solon 2002). The variables we analyze are measured using the
same data sources across all CZs. Second, and more important,
we characterize both relative and absolute mobility across CZs.
The cross-country literature has focused exclusively on differ-
ences in relative mobility; much less is known about how the
prospects of children from low-income families vary across coun-
tries when measured on a common absolute scale (Ray 2010).

Our analysis also relates to the literature on neighborhood
effects, reviewed by Jencks and Mayer (1990) and Sampson et al.
(2002). Unlike recent experimental work on neighborhood effects
(e.g., Katz, Kling, and Liebman 2001; Oreopoulos 2003), our de-
scriptive analysis does not shed light on whether the differences
in outcomes across areas are due to the causal effect of neighbor-
hoods or differences in the characteristics of people living in those
neighborhoods. However, in a followup paper, Chetty and
Hendren (2014) show that a substantial portion of the spatial
variation documented here is driven by causal effects of place
by studying families that move across areas with children of dif-
ferent ages.
The article is organized as follows. We begin in Section II by
deﬁning the measures of intergenerational mobility that we
study and discussing their conceptual properties. Section III
describes the data. Section IV reports estimates of intergenera-
tional mobility at the national level. In Section V, we present
estimates of absolute and relative mobility by commuting zone.
Section VI reports correlations of our mobility measures with
observable characteristics of commuting zones. Section VII con-
cludes. Statistics on intergenerational mobility and related covar-
iates are publicly available by commuting zone, metropolitan
statistical area, and county on the project website (www.equali-
ty-of-opportunity.org).
II. Measures of Intergenerational Mobility
At the most general level, studies of intergenerational mobil-
ity seek to measure the degree to which a child’s social and eco-
nomic opportunities depend on his parents’ income or social
status. Because opportunities are difﬁcult to measure, virtually
all empirical studies of mobility measure the extent to which a
child’s income (or occupation) depends on his parents’ income (or
occupation).4 Following this approach, we aim to characterize the
4. This simpliﬁcation is not innocuous, as a child’s realized income may differ
from his opportunities. For instance, children of wealthy parents may choose not to
work or may choose lower-paying jobs, which would reduce the persistence of
income across generations relative to the persistence of underlying opportunities.

joint distribution of a child’s lifetime pretax family income (Yi),
and his parents’ lifetime pretax family income (Xi).5
In large samples, one can characterize the joint distribution
of (Yi, Xi) nonparametrically, and we provide such a characteri-
zation in the form of a 100  100 centile transition matrix below.
However, to provide a parsimonious summary of the degree of
mobility and compare rates of mobility across areas, it is useful
to characterize the joint distribution using a small set of statis-
tics. We divide measures of mobility into two classes that capture
different normative concepts: relative mobility and absolute mo-
bility. In this section, we deﬁne a set of statistics that we use to
measure these two concepts empirically and compare their con-
ceptual properties.
II.A.
Relative Mobility
One way to study intergenerational mobility is to ask, ‘‘What
are the outcomes of children from low-income families relative to
those of children from high-income families?’’ This question,
which focuses on the relative outcomes of children from different
parental backgrounds, has been the subject of most prior research
on intergenerational mobility (Solon 1999; Black et al. 2011).
The canonical measure of relative mobility is the elasticity of
child income with respect to parent income
dE½log YijXi¼x
dlog x


, com-
monly called the intergenerational income elasticity (IGE). The
most common method of estimating the IGE is to regress log child
income (logYi) on log parent income (logXi), which yields a coefﬁ-
cient of
IGE ¼ XY
SDðlogYiÞ
SDðlogXiÞ ;
ð1Þ
where XY ¼ Corr(logXi, logYi) is the correlation between log child
income and parent income and SD() denotes the standard devia-
tion. The IGE is a relative mobility measure because it measures
the difference in (log) outcomes between children of high versus
low income parents.
5. If taxes and transfers do not generate rank reversals (as is typically the case
in practice), using post-tax income instead of pretax income would have no effect on
our preferred rank-based measures of mobility. See Mitnik et al. (2014) for a com-
parison of pretax and post-tax measures of the IGE of income.

--- Page 9 ---
An alternative measure of relative mobility is the correlation
between child and parent ranks (Dahl and DeLeire 2008). Let Ri
denote child i’s percentile rank in the income distribution of chil-
dren and Pi denote parent i’s percentile rank in the income dis-
tribution of parents. Regressing the child’s rank Ri on his parents’
rank Pi yields a regression coefﬁcient PR ¼ Corr(Pi, Ri), which we
call the rank-rank slope.6 The rank-rank slope PR measures the
association between a child’s position in the income distribution
and his parents’ position in the distribution.
To understand the connection between the IGE and the rank-
rank slope, note that the correlation of log incomes XY and the
correlation of ranks PR are closely related scale-invariant mea-
sures of the degree to which child income depends on parent
income.7 Hence, equation (1) implies that the IGE combines the
dependence features captured by the rank-rank slope with the
ratio of standard deviations of income across generations.8
The IGE differs from the rank-rank slope to the extent that in-
equality changes across generations. Intuitively, a given increase
in parents’ incomes has a greater effect on the level of children’s
incomes when inequality is greater among children than among
parents.
We estimate both the IGE and the rank-rank slope to distin-
guish differences in mobility from differences in inequality and to
provide a comparison to the prior literature. However, we focus
primarily on rank-rank slopes because they prove to be much
more robust across speciﬁcations and are thus more suitable for
comparisons across areas from a statistical perspective.
II.B.
Absolute Mobility
A different way to measure intergenerational mobility is to
ask, ‘‘What are the outcomes of children from families of a given
income level in absolute terms?’’ For example, one may be
6. The regression coefﬁcient equals the correlation coefﬁcient because both
child and parent ranks follow a uniform distribution by construction.
7. For example, if parent and child income follow a bivariate log normal dis-
tribution, PR ¼ 6ArcSinð
XY
2 Þ
p
& 3XY
p
¼ 0:95XY when XY is small (Trivedi and Zimmer
2007).
8. More generally, the joint distribution of parent and child incomes can be
decomposed into two components: the joint distribution of parent and child percen-
tile ranks (the copula) and the marginal distributions of parent and child income.
The rank-rank slope depends purely on the copula, whereas the IGE combines both
components.

interested in measuring the mean outcomes of children whose
grow up in low-income families. Absolute mobility may be of
greater normative interest than relative mobility. Increases in
relative mobility (i.e., a lower IGE or rank-rank slope) could be
undesirable if they are caused by worse outcomes for the rich. In
contrast, increases in absolute mobility at a given income level,
holding ﬁxed absolute mobility at other income levels, unambig-
uously increase welfare if one respects the Pareto principle (and if
welfare depends purely on income).
We consider three statistical measures of absolute mobility.
Our primary measure, which we call absolute upward mobility, is
the mean rank (in the national child income distribution) of chil-
dren whose parents are at the 25th percentile of the national
parent income distribution.9 At the national level, this statistic
is mechanically related to the rank-rank slope and does not pro-
vide any additional information about mobility.10 However, when
we study small areas within the United States, a child’s rank in
the national income distribution is effectively an absolute out-
come because incomes in a given area have little effect on the
national distribution.
The second measure we analyze is the probability of rising
from the bottom quintile to the top quintile of the income distri-
bution (Corak and Heisz 1999; Hertz 2006), which can be inter-
preted as a measure of the fraction of children who achieve the
‘‘American Dream.’’ Again, when the quintiles are deﬁned in the
national income distribution, these transition probabilities can
be interpreted as measures of absolute outcomes in small areas.
Our third measure is the probability that a child has family
income above the poverty line conditional on having parents at
the 25th percentile. Because the poverty line is deﬁned in abso-
lute dollar terms in the United States, this statistic measures the
9. This measure is the analog of the rank-rank slope in terms of absolute mo-
bility.ThecorrespondinganalogoftheIGEisthemeanlogincomeofchildren whose
parents are at the 25th percentile. We do not study this statistic because it is very
sensitive to the treatment of zeros and small incomes.
10. We show below that the rank-rank relationship is approximately linear.
Because child and parent ranks each have a mean of 0.5 by construction in the
national distribution, the mean rank of children with parents at percentile p is
simply 0.5 þ PR(p – 0.5). Conceptually, the slope is the only free parameter in the
linear national rank-rank relationship. Intuitively, if one child moves up in the
income distribution in terms of ranks, another must come down.

It is useful to analyze multiple measures of mobility because
the appropriate measure of intergenerational mobility depends
on one’s normative objective (Fields and Ok 1999). Fortunately,
we ﬁnd that the patterns of spatial variation in absolute and rel-
ative mobility are very similar using alternative measures. In
addition, we provide nonparametric transition matrices and mar-
ginal distributions that allow readers to construct measures of
mobility beyond those we consider here.
III. Data
We use data from federal income tax records spanning 1996–
2012. The data include both income tax returns (1040 forms) and
third-party information returns (such as W-2 forms), which give
us information on the earnings of those who do not ﬁle tax re-
turns. We provide a detailed description of how we construct our
analysis sample starting from the raw population data in Online
Appendix A. Here, we brieﬂy summarize the key variable and
sample deﬁnitions. Note that in what follows, the year always
refers to the tax year (i.e., the calendar year in which the
income is earned).
III.A.
Sample Deﬁnitions
Our base data set of children consists of all individuals who
(i) have a valid Social Security number or individual taxpayer
identiﬁcation number, (ii) were born between 1980 and 1991,
and (iii) are U.S. citizens as of 2013. We impose the citizenship
requirement to exclude individuals who are likely to have immi-
grated to the United States as adults, for whom we cannot mea-
sure parent income. We cannot directly restrict the sample to
individuals born in the United States because the database only
records current citizenship status.
We identify the parents of a child as the ﬁrst tax ﬁlers (be-
tween 1996 and 2012) who claim the child as a child dependent
and were between the ages of 15 and 40 when the child was born.
11. Another intuitive measure of upward mobility is the fraction of children
whose income exceeds that of their parents. This statistic turns out to be problem-
atic for our application because we measure parent and child income at different
ages and because it is very sensitive to differences in local income distributions.

If the child is ﬁrst claimed by a single ﬁler, the child is deﬁned as
having a single parent. For simplicity, we assign each child a
parent (or parents) permanently using this algorithm, regardless
of any subsequent changes in parents’ marital status or depen-
dent claiming.12
If parents never ﬁle a tax return, we cannot link them to their
child. Although some low-income individuals do not ﬁle tax re-
turns in a given year, almost all parents ﬁle a tax return at
some point between 1996 and 2012 to obtain a tax refund on
their withheld taxes and the Earned Income Tax Credit (Cilke
1998). We are therefore able to identify parents for approximately
95 percent of the children in the 1980–1991 birth cohorts. The
fraction of children linked to parents drops sharply prior to the
1980 birth cohort because our data begin in 1996 and many chil-
dren begin to the leave the household starting at age 17 (Online
Appendix Table I). This is why we limit our analysis to children
born during or after 1980.
Our primary analysis sample, which we refer to as the core
sample, includes all children in the base data set who (i) are born
in the 1980–1982 birth cohorts, (ii) for whom we are able to iden-
tify parents, and (iii) whose mean parent income between 1996
and 2000 is strictly positive (which excludes 1.2% of children).13
For some robustness checks, we use the extended sample, which
imposes the same restrictions as the core sample, but includes all
birth cohorts from 1980 to 1991. There are approximately 10 mil-
lion children in the core sample and 44 million children in the
extended sample.
1. Statistics of Income Sample. Because we can only reliably
link children to parents starting with the 1980 birth cohort in the
population tax data, we can only measure earnings of children up
to age 32 (in 2012) in the full sample. To evaluate whether
12. Twelve percent of children in our core sample are claimed as dependents by
different individuals in subsequent years. To ensure that this potential measure-
ment error in linking children to parents does not affect our ﬁndings, we show that
we obtain similar estimates of mobility for the subset of children who are never
claimed by other individuals (row 9 of Online Appendix Table VII).
13. We limit the sample to parents with positive income because parents who
ﬁle a tax return (as required to link them to a child) yet have zero income are un-
likely to be representative of individuals with zero income and those with negative
income typically have large capital losses, which are a proxy for having signiﬁcant
wealth.

estimates of intergenerational mobility would change signiﬁ-
cantly if earnings were measured at later ages, we supplement
our analysis using annual cross-sections of tax returns main-
tained by the Statistics of Income (SOI) division of the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) prior to 1996. The SOI cross-sections pro-
vide identiﬁers for dependents claimed on tax forms starting in
1987, allowing us to link parents to children back to the 1971
birth cohort using an algorithm analogous to that described
above (see Online Appendix A for further details). The SOI
cross-sections are stratiﬁed random samples of tax returns with
a sampling probability that rises with income; using sampling
weights, we can calculate statistics representative of the national
distribution. After linking parents to children in the SOI sample,
we use population tax data to obtain data on income for children
and parents, using the same deﬁnitions as in the core sample.
There are approximately 63,000 children in the 1971–1979
birth cohorts in the SOI sample (Online Appendix Table II).
III.B.
Variable Deﬁnitions and Summary Statistics
In this section, we deﬁne the key variables we use to measure
intergenerational mobility. We measure all monetary variables in
2012 dollars, adjusting for inﬂation using the consumer price
index (CPI-U).
1. Parent Income. Following Lee and Solon (2009), our
primary measure of parent income is total pretax income at
the household level, which we label parent family income.
More precisely, in years where a parent ﬁles a tax return, we de-
ﬁne family income as adjusted gross income (as reported on the
1040 tax return) plus tax-exempt interest income and the non-
taxable portion of Social Security and Disability (SSDI) beneﬁts.
In years where a parent does not ﬁle a tax return, we deﬁne
family income as the sum of wage earnings (reported on form
W-2), unemployment beneﬁts (reported on form 1099-G), and
gross social security and disability beneﬁts (reported on form
SA-1099) for both parents.14 In years where parents have no
14. The database does not record W-2s and other information returns prior to
1999, so nonﬁler’s income is coded as 0 prior to 1999. Assigning nonﬁling parents 0
income has little effect on our estimates because only 2.9% of parents in our core
sample do not ﬁle in each year prior to 1999 and most nonﬁlers have very low W-2
income. For instance, in 2000, median W-2 income among nonﬁlers was $29.

tax return and no information returns, family income is coded as
zero.15
Our baseline income measure includes labor earnings and
capital income as well as unemployment insurance, Social
Security, and disability beneﬁts. It excludes nontaxable cash
transfers such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and
Supplemental Security Income, in-kind beneﬁts such as food
stamps, all refundable tax credits such as the EITC, nontaxable
pension contributions (such as to 401(k)s), and any earned income
not reported to the IRS. Income is always measured prior to the
deduction of individual income taxes and employee-level payroll
taxes.
In our baseline analysis, we average parents’ family income
over the ﬁve years from 1996 to 2000 to obtain a proxy for parent
lifetime income that is less affected by transitory ﬂuctuations
(Solon 1992). We use the earliest years in our sample to best re-
ﬂect the economic resources of parents while the children in our
sample are growing up.16 We evaluate the robustness of our ﬁnd-
ings using data from other years and using a measure of individ-
ual parent income instead of family income. We deﬁne individual
income as the sum of individual W-2 wage earnings, unemploy-
ment insurance beneﬁts, SSDI payments, and half of household
self-employment income (see Online Appendix A for details).
Furthermore, we show below that deﬁning parent income based on data from 1999
to 2003 (when W-2 data are available) yields virtually identical estimates (Table I,
row 5). Note that we never observe self-employment income for nonﬁlers and there-
fore code it as 0; given the strong incentives for individuals with children to ﬁle
created by the EITC, most nonﬁlers likely have very low levels of self-employment
income as well.
15. Importantly, these observations are true zeros rather than missing data.
Because the database covers all tax records, we know that these individuals have 0
taxable income.
16. Formally, we deﬁne mean family income as the mother’s family income plus
the father’s family income in each year from 1996 to 2000 divided by 10 (by 5 if we
only identify a single parent). For parents who do not change marital status, this is
simply mean family income over the ﬁve-year period. For parents who are married
initially and then divorce, this measure tracks the mean family incomes of the two
parents over time. For parents who are single initially and then get married, this
measure tracks individual income prior to marriage and total family income (in-
cluding the new spouse’s income) after marriage. These household measures of
income increase with marriage and naturally do not account for cohabitation; to
ensure that these features do not generate bias, we assess the robustness of our
results to using individual measures of income.

2. Child Income. We deﬁne child family income in the same
way as parent family income. In our baseline analysis, we aver-
age child family income over the last two years in our data (2011
and 2012), when children are in their early thirties. We report
results using alternative years to assess the sensitivity of our
ﬁndings. For children, we deﬁne household income based on cur-
rent marital status rather than marital status at a ﬁxed point in
time. Because family income varies with marital status, we also
report results using individual income measures for children,
constructed in the same way as for parents.
3. College Attendance. We deﬁne college attendance as an in-
dicator for having one or more 1098-T forms ﬁled on one’s behalf
when the individual is aged 18–21. Title IV institutions—all col-
leges and universities as well as vocational schools and other
postsecondary institutions eligible for federal student aid—are
required to ﬁle 1098-T forms that report tuition payments or
scholarships received for every student. Because the forms are
ﬁled directly by colleges, independent of whether an individual
ﬁles a tax return, we have complete records on college attendance
for all children. The 1098-T data are available from 1999 to 2012.
Comparisons to other data sources indicate that 1098-T forms
capture college enrollment quite accurately overall (Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff 2014, Appendix B).17
4. College Quality. Using data from 1098-T forms, Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff (2014) construct an earnings-based
index of ‘‘college quality’’ using the mean individual wage earn-
ings at age 31 of children born in 1979–1980 based on the college
they attended at age 20. Children who do not attend college are
included in a separate ‘‘no college’’ category in this index. We
assign each child in our sample a value of this college quality
index based on the college in which they were enrolled at age
17. Colleges are not required to ﬁle 1098-T forms for students whose qualiﬁed
tuition and related expenses are waived or paid entirely with scholarships or
grants. However, the forms are frequently available even for such cases, presum-
ably because of automated reporting to the IRS by universities. Approximately 6%
of 1098-T forms are missing from 2000 to 2003 because the database contains no
1098-T forms for some small colleges in these years. To verify that this does not
affect our results, we conﬁrm that our estimates of college attendance by parent
income gradients are very similar for later birth cohorts (not reported).

20. We then convert this dollar index to percentile ranks within
each birth cohort. The children in the no-college group, who con-
stitute roughly 54 percent of our core sample, all have the same
value of the college quality index. Breaking ties at the mean, we
assign all of these children a college quality rank of approxi-
mately 54
2 ¼ 27.18
5. Teenage Birth. We deﬁne a woman as having a teenage
birth if she ever claims a dependent who was born while she
was between the ages of 13 and 19. This measure is an imperfect
proxy for having a teenage birth because it only covers children
who are claimed as dependents by their mothers. Nevertheless,
the aggregate level and spatial pattern of teenage births in our
data are closely aligned with estimates based on the American
Community Survey.19
6. Summary Statistics. Online Appendix Table III reports
summary statistics for the core sample. Median parent family
income is $60,129 (in 2012 dollars). Among the 30.6% of children
matched to single parents, 72.0% are matched to a female parent.
Children in our core sample have a median family income of
$34,975 when they are approximately 30 years old; 6.1% of chil-
dren have zero income in both 2011 and 2012; 58.9% are enrolled
in a college at some point between the ages of 18 and 21; and
15.8% of women have a teenage birth.
In Online Appendix B and Appendix Table IV, we show
that the total cohort size, labor force participation rate, distri-
bution of child income, and other demographic characteristics of
our core sample line up closely with corresponding estimates in
the Current Population Survey and American Community
Survey. This conﬁrms that our sample covers roughly the same
nationally representative population as previous survey-based
research.
18. The exact value varies across cohorts. For example, in the 1980 birth cohort,
55.1% of children do not attend college. We assign these children a rank of
55:1
2
þ 0:02 ¼ 27:7% because 0.2% of children in the 1980 birth cohort attend colleges
whose mean earnings are below the mean earnings of those not in college.
19. Of women in our core sample, 15.8% have teenage births; the corresponding
number is 14.6% in the 2003 ACS. The unweighted correlation between state-level
teenage birth rates in the tax data and the ACS is 0.80.

IV. National Statistics
We begin our empirical analysis by characterizing the rela-
tionship between parent and child income at the national level.
We ﬁrst present a set of baseline estimates of relative mobility
and then evaluate the robustness of our estimates to alternative
sample and income deﬁnitions.20
IV.A.
Baseline Estimates
In our baseline analysis, we use the core sample (1980–1982
birth cohorts) and measure parent income as mean family income
from 1996 to 2000 and child income as mean family income in
2011–2012, when children are approximately 30 years old.
Figure I Panel A presents a binned scatter plot of the mean
family income of children versus the mean family income of
their parents. To construct this ﬁgure, we divide the horizontal
axis into 100 equal-sized (percentile) bins and plot mean child
income versus mean parent income in each bin.21 This binned
scatter plot provides a nonparametric representation of the con-
ditional expectation of child income given parent income,
E[YijXi ¼ x]. The regression coefﬁcients and standard errors re-
ported in this and all subsequent binned scatter plots are esti-
mated on the underlying microdata using OLS regressions.
The conditional expectation of children’s income given par-
ents’ income is strongly concave. Below the 90th percentile of
parent income, a $1 increase in parent family income is associ-
ated with a 33.5 cent increase in average child family income. In
contrast, between the 90th and 99th percentile, a $1 increase in
parent income is associated with only a 7.6 cent increase in child
income.
20. We do not present estimates of absolute mobility at the national level be-
cause absolute mobility in terms of percentile ranks is mechanically related to rel-
ative mobility at the national level (see Section II). Although one can compute
measures of absolute mobility at the national level based on mean incomes (e.g.,
the mean income of children whose parents are at the 25th percentile), there is no
natural benchmark for such a statistic as it has not been computed in other coun-
tries or time periods.
21. For scaling purposes, we exclude the top bin (parents in the top 1%) in this
ﬁgure only; mean parent income in this bin is $1,408,760 and mean child income is
$113,846.

FIGURE I
Association between Children’s and Parents’ Incomes
These ﬁgures present nonparametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between child income and parent income. Both panels
are based on the core sample (1980–1982 birth cohorts) and baseline family income deﬁnitions for parents and children. Child income
is the mean of 2011–2012 family income (when the child is approximately 30 years old), whereas parent income is mean family income
from 1996 to 2000. Incomes are in 2012 dollars. To construct Panel A, we bin parent family income into 100 equal-sized (centile) bins
and plot the mean level of child income versus mean level of parent income within each bin. For scaling purposes, we do not show the
point for the top 1% in Panel A. In the top 1% bin, mean parent income is $1.4 million and mean child income is $114,000. In Panel B,
we again bin parent family income into 100 bins and plot mean log income for children (left y-axis) and the fraction of children with
zero family income (right y-axis) versus mean parents’ log income. Children with zero family income are excluded from the log income
series. In both panels, the 10th and 90th percentile of parents’ income are depicted in dashed vertical lines. The coefﬁcient estimates
and standard errors (in parentheses) reported on the ﬁgures are obtained from OLS regressions on the microdata. In Panel A, we
report separate slopes for parents below the 90th percentile and parents between the 90th and 99th percentile. In Panel B, we report
slopes of the log-log regression (i.e., the intergenerational elasticity of income or IGE) in the full sample and for parents between the
10th and 90th percentiles.

Notes. Each cell in this table reports the coefﬁcient from a univariate OLS regression of an outcome for children on a measure of their parents’ incomes with standard errors in
parentheses. All rows report estimates of slope coefﬁcients from linear regressions of the child outcome on the parent income measure except row 10, in which we regress college
quality rank on a quadratic in parent income rank (as in Figure IV Panel A). In this row, we report the difference between the ﬁtted values for children with parents at the 75th
percentile and parents at the 25th percentile using the quadratic speciﬁcation. Column (1) uses the core sample of children, which includes all current U.S. citizens with a valid
SSN or ITIN who are (i) born in birth cohorts 1980–1982, (ii) for whom we are able to identify parents based on dependent claiming, and (iii) whose mean parent income over the
years 1996–2000 is strictly positive. Columns (2) and (3) limit the sample used in column (1) to males or females. Columns (4) and (5) limit the sample to children whose parents
were married or unmarried in the year the child was linked to the parent. Column (6) uses all children in the 1980–1985 birth cohorts. Column (7) restricts the core sample to
children whose parents both fall within a 5-year window of median parent age at time of child birth (age 26–30 for fathers; 24–28 for mothers); we impose only one of these
restrictions for single parents. Child family income is the mean of 2011–2012 family income, while parent family income is the mean from 1996 to 2000. Parent top earner income is
the mean income of the higher-earning spouse between 1999–2003 (when W-2 data are available). Child’s individual income is the sum of W-2 wage earnings, UI beneﬁts, and SSDI
beneﬁts, and half of any remaining income reported on the 1040 form. Individual earnings includes W-2 wage earnings, UI beneﬁts, SSDI income, and self-employment income.
College attendance is deﬁned as ever attending college from age 18 to 21, where attending college is deﬁned as presence of a 1098-T form. College quality rank is deﬁned as the
percentile rank of the college that the child attends at age 20 based on the mean earnings at age 31 of children who attended the same college (children who do not attend college
are included in a separate ‘‘no college’’ group); see Section III.B for further details. Teenage birth is deﬁned as having a child while between age 13 and 19. In columns (1)–(5) and
(7), income percentile ranks are constructed by ranking all children relative to others in their birth cohort based on the relevant income deﬁnition and ranking all parents relative
to other parents in the core sample. Ranks are always deﬁned on the full sample of all children; that is, they are not redeﬁned within the subsamples in columns (2)–(5) or (7). In
column (6), parents are ranked relative to other parents with children in the 1980–1985 birth cohorts. The number of observations corresponds to the speciﬁcation in row 4. The
number of observations is approximately 7% lower in row 1 because we exclude children with zero income. The number of observations is approximately 50% lower in row 11
because we restrict to the sample of female children. There are 866 children in the core sample with unknown sex, which is why the number of observations in the core sample is
not equal to the sum of the observations in the male and female samples.

1. Log-Log Intergenerational Elasticity Estimates. Partly mo-
tivated by the nonlinearity of the relationship in Figure I Panel A,
the canonical approach to characterizing the joint distribution of
child and parent income is to regress the log of child income on the
log of parent income (as discussed in Section II), excluding chil-
dren with zero income. This regression yields an estimated IGE of
0.344, as shown in the ﬁrst column of row 1 of Table I.
Unfortunately, this estimate turns out to be quite sensitive to
changes in the regression speciﬁcations for two reasons, illus-
trated in Figure I Panel B. First, the relationship between log
child income and log parent income is highly nonlinear, consis-
tent with the ﬁndings of Corak and Heisz (1999) in Canadian tax
data. This is illustrated in the series in circles in Figure I Panel B,
which plots mean log child income versus mean log family income
by percentile bin, constructed using the same method as Figure I
Panel A. Because of this nonlinearity, the IGE is sensitive to the
point of measurement in the income distribution. For example,
restricting the sample to observations between the 10th and
90th percentile of parent income (denoted by the vertical
dashed lines in the graph) yields a considerably higher IGE
estimate of 0.452.
Second, the log-log speciﬁcation discards observations with
zero income. The series in triangles in Figure I Panel B plots the
fraction of children with zero income by parental income bin. This
fraction varies from 17% among the poorest families to 3% among
the richest families. Dropping children with zero income there-
fore overstates the degree of intergenerational mobility. The way
these zeros are treated can change the IGE dramatically. For
instance, including the zeros by assigning those with zero
income an income of $1 (so that the log of their income is zero)
raises the estimated IGE to 0.618, as shown in row 2 of Table I. If
instead we treat those with 0 income as having an income of
$1,000, the estimated IGE becomes 0.413. These exercises show
that small differences in the way children’s income is measured at
the bottom of the distribution can produce substantial variation
in IGE estimates.
Columns (2)–(7) in Table I replicate the baseline speciﬁcation
in column (1) for alternative subsamples analyzed in the prior
literature. Columns (2)–(5) split the sample by the child’s
gender and the parents’ marital status in the year they ﬁrst
claim the child. Column (6) replicates column (1) for the extended
sample of 1980–1985 birth cohorts. Column (7) restricts the

28 and fathers are between 26 and 30 (a 5-year window around
the median age of birth). This column eliminates variation in
parent income correlated with differences in parent age at child
birth and restricts the sample to parents who are younger than 50
years when we measure their incomes (for children born in 1980).
Across these subsamples, the IGE estimates range from 0.264 (for
children of single parents, excluding children with zero income) to
0.697 (for male children, recoding zeroes to $1).
The IGE is unstable because the income distribution is
not well approximated by a bivariate log-normal distribution, a
result that was not apparent in smaller samples used in prior
work. This makes it difﬁcult to obtain reliable comparisons
of mobility across samples or geographical areas using the
IGE.
For
example,
income
measures
in
survey
data
are
typically top-coded and sometimes include transfers and other
sources of income that increase incomes at the bottom of the
distribution, which may lead to larger IGE estimates than those ob-
tained in administrative data sets such as the one used here.
In a recent paper, Mitnik et al. (2014) propose a new measure
of the IGE, the elasticity of expected child income with respect to
parent income
dlog E½YijXi¼x
dlog x


, which they show is more robust to
the treatment of small incomes. In large samples, one can estimate
this parameter by regressing the log of mean child income in each
percentile bin (plotted in Figure I Panel A) on the log of mean
parent income in each bin. In Online Appendix C, we show that
Mitnik et al.’s statistic can be interpreted as a dollar-weighted
average of elasticities (placing greater weight on high-income chil-
dren), whereas the traditional IGE weights all individuals with
positive income equally. These two parameters need not coincide
in general and the ‘‘correct’’ parameter depends on the policy ques-
tion one seeks to answer. However, it turns out that in our data,
the Mitnik et al. dollar-weighted IGE estimate is 0.335, very sim-
ilar to our baseline IGE estimate of 0.344 when excluding children
with zero income (Online Appendix Figure I Panel A).22
22. Mitnik et al. (2014) ﬁnd larger estimates of the dollar-weighted IGE in their
sample of tax returns. A useful direction for further work would be to understand
why the two samples yield different IGE estimates.

In another recent study, Clark (2014) argues that traditional
estimates of the IGE understate the persistence of status across
generations because they are attenuated by ﬂuctuations in real-
ized individual incomes across generations. To resolve this prob-
lem, Clark estimates the IGE based on surname-level means of
income in each generation and obtains a central IGE estimate of
0.8, much larger than that in prior studies. In our data, estimates
of mobility based on surname means are similar to our baseline
estimates based on individual income data (Online Appendix
Table V). One reason that Clark (2014) may obtain larger esti-
mates of intergenerational persistence is that his focus on distinc-
tive surnames partly identiﬁes the degree of convergence in
income between racial or ethnic groups (Borjas 1992) rather
than across individuals (see Online Appendix D for further
details).23
2. Rank-Rank Estimates. Next we present estimates of the
rank-rank slope, the second measure of relative mobility dis-
cussed in Section II. We measure the percentile rank of parents
Pi based on their positions in the distribution of parent incomes in
the core sample. Similarly, we deﬁne children’s percentile ranks
Ri based on their positions in the distribution of child incomes
within their birth cohorts. Importantly, this deﬁnition allows us
to include zeros in child income.24 Unless otherwise noted, we
hold the deﬁnition of these ranks ﬁxed based on positions in the
aggregate distribution, even when analyzing subgroups.
Figure II Panel A presents a binned scatter plot of the mean
percentile rank of children E[RijPi ¼ p] versus their parents’ per-
centile rank p. The conditional expectation of a child’s rank given
his parents’ rank is almost perfectly linear. Using an OLS regres-
sion, we estimate that a 1 percentage point (pp) increase in parent
rank is associated with a 0.341 pp increase in the child’s mean
23. For example, Clark (2014, p. 60, Figure 3.10) compares the outcomes of
individuals with the surname Katz (a predominantly Jewish name) versus
Washington (a predominantly black name). This comparison generates an implied
IGE close to 1, which partly reﬂects the fact that the black-white income gap has
changed very little over the past few decades. Estimates of the IGE based on indi-
vidual-level data (or pooling all surnames) are much lower because there is much
more social mobility within racial groups.
24. In the case of ties, we deﬁne the rank as the mean rank for the individuals in
that group. For example, if 10% of a birth cohort has zero income, all children with
zero income would receive a percentile rank of 5.

Association between Children’s and Parents’ Percentile Ranks
These ﬁgures present nonparametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between children’s and parent’s percentile income
ranks. Both ﬁgures are based on the core sample (1980–1982 birth cohorts) and baseline family income deﬁnitions for parents and
children. Child income is the mean of 2011–2012 family income (when the child is approximately 30 years old), and parent income is
mean family income from 1996 to 2000. Children are ranked relative to other children in their birth cohort, and parents are ranked
relative to all other parents in the core sample. Panel A plots the mean child percentile rank within each parent percentile rank bin.
The series in triangles in Panel B plots the analogous series for Denmark, computed by Boserup, Kopczuk, and Kreiner (2013) using a
similar sample and income deﬁnitions. The series in squares plots estimates of the rank-rank series using the decile-decile transition
matrix from Corak and Heisz (1999). The series in circles in Panel B reproduces the rank-rank relationship in the United States from
Panel A as a reference. The slopes and best-ﬁt lines are estimated using an OLS regression on the microdata for the United States and
on the binned series (as we do not have access to the microdata) for Denmark and Canada. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses.

rank, as reported in row 4 of Table I. The rank-rank slope esti-
mates are generally quite similar across subsamples, as shown in
columns (2)–(7) of Table I.
Figure II Panel B compares the rank-rank relationship in the
United States with analogous estimates for Denmark constructed
using data from Boserup, Kopczuk, and Kreiner (2013) and esti-
mates for Canada constructed from the decile transition matrix
reported by Corak and Heisz (1999).25 The relationship between
child and parent ranks is nearly linear in Denmark and Canada
as well, suggesting that the rank-rank speciﬁcation provides a
good summary of mobility across diverse environments. The
rank-rank slope is 0.180 in Denmark and 0.174 in Canada,
nearly half that in the United States.
Importantly, the smaller rank-rank slopes in Denmark and
Canada do not necessarily mean that children from low-income
families in these countries do better than those in the United
States in absolute terms. It could be that children of high-
income parents in Denmark and Canada have worse outcomes
than children of high-income parents in the United States. One

25. Both the Danish and Canadian studies use administrative earnings infor-
mation for large samples as we do here. The Danish sample, which was constructed
to match the analysis sample in this article as closely as possible, consists of chil-
dren in the 1980–1981 birth cohorts and measures child income based on mean
income between 2009 and 2011. Child income in the Danish sample is measured at
the individual level, and parents’ income is the mean of the two biological parents’
income from 1997 to 1999, irrespective of their marital status. The Canadian
sample is less comparable to our sample, as it consists of male children in the
1963–1966 birth cohorts and studies the link between their mean earnings from
1993 to 1995 and their fathers’ mean earnings from 1978 to 1982.

cannot distinguish between these possibilities because the ranks
are deﬁned within each country. One advantage of the within–
United States CZ-level analysis implemented below is that it nat-
urally allows us to study both relative and absolute outcomes by
analyzing children’s performance on a ﬁxed national scale.
3. Transition Matrixes. Table II presents a quintile transition
matrix: the probability that a child is in quintile m of the child
income distribution conditional on his parent being in quintile n
of the parent income distribution. One statistic of particular in-
terest in this matrix is the probability of moving from the bottom
quintile to the top quintile, a simple measure of success that we
return to later. This probability is 7.5% in the United States,
compared with 11.7% in Denmark (Boserup, Kopczuk, and
Kreiner 2013) and 13.4% in Canada (Corak and Heisz 1999). In
this sense, the chances of achieving the American dream are con-
siderably higher for children in Denmark and Canada than those
in the United States.
In Online Data Table I, we report a 100  100 percentile-level
transition matrix for the United States. Using this matrix and the
marginal distributions for child and parent income in Online
Data Table II, one can construct any mobility statistic of interest
for the U.S. population.26
IV.B.
Robustness of Baseline Estimates
We now evaluate the robustness of our estimates of interge-
nerational mobility to alternative speciﬁcations. We begin by
evaluating two potential sources of bias emphasized in prior
work: life cycle bias and attenuation bias.
1. Life Cycle Bias. Prior research has shown that measuring
children’s income at early ages can understate intergenerational
persistence in lifetime income because children with high lifetime
incomes have steeper earnings proﬁles when they are young
(Solon 1999; Grawe 2006; Haider and Solon 2006). To evaluate
whether our baseline estimates suffer from such life cycle bias,
Figure III Panel A plots estimates of the rank-rank slope by the
age at which the child’s income is measured. We construct the

FIGURE III
Robustness of Intergenerational Mobility Estimates
This ﬁgure evaluates the robustness of the rank-rank slope estimated in Figure II Panel A to changes in the age at which child
income is measured (Panel A) and the number of years used to measure parents’ income (Panel B). In both panels, child income is
deﬁned as mean family income in 2011 to 2012. In Panel A, parent income is deﬁned as mean family income from 1996 to 2000. Each
point in Panel A shows the slope coefﬁcient from a separate OLS regression of child income rank on parent income rank, varying the
child’s birth cohort and hence the child’s age in 2011–2012 when the child’s income is measured. The circles use the extended sample
in the population data, and the triangles use the 0.1% Statistics of Income (SOI) stratiﬁed random sample. The ﬁrst point in Panel A
corresponds to the children in the 1990 birth cohort, who are 21–22 when their incomes are measured in 2011–2012 (denoted by age 22
on the ﬁgure). The last point for which we have population-wide estimates corresponds to the 1980 cohort, who are 31–32 (denoted by
32) when their incomes are measured. The last point in the SOI sample corresponds to the 1971 cohort, who are 40–41 (denoted by 41)
when their incomes are measured. The dashed line is a lowess curve ﬁt through the SOI 0.1% sample rank-rank slope estimates. In
Panel B, we focus on children in the core sample (1980–1982 birth cohorts) in the population data. Each point in this ﬁgure shows the
coefﬁcient from the same rank-rank regression as in Figure II Panel A, varying the number of years used to compute mean parent
income. The ﬁrst point uses parent income data for 1996 only to deﬁne parent ranks. The second point uses mean parent income from
1996 to 1997. The last point uses mean parent income from 1996 to 2012, a 17-year average.

series in circles by measuring children’s income as mean family
income in 2011–2012 and parent income as mean family income
between 1996 and 2000, as in our baseline analysis. We then
replicate the OLS regression of child income rank on parent
income rank for each birth cohort between 1980 and 1990. For
children in the 1980 birth cohort, we measure earnings in 2011–
2012 at age 31–32 (denoted by 32 in the ﬁgure); for the 1990
cohort, we measure earnings at age 21–22.27 The rank-rank
slope rises very steeply in the early twenties as children enter
the labor force, but stabilizes around age 30. It increases by 2.1%
from age 30 to 31 and 0.2% from age 31 to 32.
To obtain estimates beyond age 32, we use the SOI 0.1%
random sample described in Section III.A, which contains data
back to the 1971 birth cohort. The series in triangles in Figure III
Panel A replicates the analysis above within the SOI sample,
using sampling weights to recover estimates representative of
the population. The estimates in the SOI sample are very similar
to those in the full population prior to age 32. After age 32,
the estimates remain roughly constant. These ﬁndings indicate
that rank-rank correlations exhibit little life cycle bias provided
that child income is measured after age 30, as in our baseline
deﬁnition.
We also ﬁnd that estimates of the IGE using the traditional
log-log speciﬁcation (limiting the sample between the 10th and
90th percentiles of the parent income distribution) stabilize
around age 30, as shown in Online Appendix Figure II Panel A.
In the population data, the IGE estimate is a strictly concave
function of age and rises by only 1.7% from age 31 to 32. The
SOI 0.1% sample exhibits a similar (albeit noisier) pattern.
An analogous life cycle bias can arise if parent income is
measured at very old or young ages. In Online Appendix Figure
II Panel B we plot the rank-rank slope using the core sample,
varying the ﬁve-year window used to measure parent income
from a starting year of 1996 (when mothers are 41 years old on
average) to 2010 (when mothers are 55 years old). The rank-rank
estimates exhibit virtually no variation with the age of parent
income measurement within this range.
27. We obtain very similar results if we instead track a single cohort and vary
age by measuring earnings in different calendar years.

A closely related concern is that parent income at earlier ages
might matter more for children’s outcomes, for example, if re-
sources in early childhood are relevant for child development
(e.g., Heckman 2006; Duncan, Ziol-Guest, and Kalil 2010).
Although we cannot measure parent income before age 14 for
children in our core sample, we can measure parent income at
earlier ages for later birth cohorts. In Chetty et al. (2014), we use
data from the 1993 birth cohort and regress an indicator for col-
lege attendance at age 19 on parent income rank in each year
from 1996 to 2012. We reproduce the coefﬁcients from those
regressions in Online Appendix Figure II Panel C. The relation-
ship between college attendance rates and parent income rank is
virtually constant when children are between ages 3 and 19. Once
again, this result indicates that the point at which parent income
is measured (provided parents are between ages 30–55) does not
signiﬁcantly affect intergenerational associations, at least in ad-
ministrative earnings records.28
2. Attenuation Bias. Income in a single year is a noisy
measure of lifetime income, which attenuates estimates of inter-
generational persistence (Solon (1992)). To evaluate whether our
baseline estimates suffer from such attenuation bias, Figure III
Panel B plots estimates of the rank-rank slope, varying the
number of years used to calculate mean parent family income.
In this ﬁgure, we plot the slope from an OLS regression of child
rank on parent rank (as in row 4, column (1) of Table I), varying
the number of years used to calculate mean parent income from
one (1996 only) to 17 (1996–2012). The rank-rank slope based on
ﬁve years of data (0.341) is 6.6% larger than the slope based on
one year of parent income (0.320). Solon (1992) ﬁnds a 33% in-
crease in the IGE (from 0.3 to 0.4) when using a ﬁve-year average
instead of one year of data in the PSID. We ﬁnd less attenuation
bias for three reasons: (i) income is measured with less error in
the tax data than in the PSID; (ii) we use family income measures
28. Although we cannot measure income before the year in which children turn
3, the fact that the college-income gradient is not declining from ages 3 to 19 makes
it unlikely that the gradient is signiﬁcantly larger prior to age 2. Parent in-
come ranks in year t have a correlation of 0.91 with parent income ranks in year
t þ 1, 0.77 in year t þ 5, and 0.65 in year t þ 15. The decay in this autocorrelation
would generate a decreasing slope in the gradient in Online Appendix Figure II
Panel C if there were a discontinuous jump in the gradient prior to age 2.

rather than individual income, which ﬂuctuates more across
years; and (iii) we use a rank-rank speciﬁcation rather than a
log-log speciﬁcation, which is more sensitive to income ﬂuctua-
tions at the bottom of the distribution.
Mazumder (2005) reports that even ﬁve-year averages of
parent income yield attenuated estimates of intergenerational
persistence relative to longer time averages. Contrary to this
result, we ﬁnd that the rank-rank slope is virtually unchanged
by adding more years of data beyond 5 years: the estimated slope
using 15 years of data to measure parent income (0.350) is only
2.8% larger than the baseline slope of 0.341 using 5 years of data.
We believe our results differ because we directly measure parent
income, whereas Mazumder imputes parent income based on race
and education for up to 60% of the observations in his sample,
with a higher imputation rate when measuring parent income
using more years (see Online Appendix E for further details).
Such imputations are analogous to instrumenting for income
with race and education, which is known to yield upward-
biased estimates of intergenerational persistence (Solon 1992).
We analyze the effect of varying the number of years used to
measure the child’s income in Online Appendix Figure II Panel D.
The rank-rank slope increases very little when increasing the
number of years used to compute child family income, with no
detectable change once one averages over at least two years, as in
our baseline measure. An ancillary implication of this result is
that our estimates of intergenerational mobility are not sensitive
to the calendar year in which we measure children’s incomes.
This ﬁnding is consistent with the results of Chetty et al.
(2014), who show that estimates of intergenerational mobility
do not vary signiﬁcantly across birth cohorts when income is mea-
sured at a ﬁxed age.
3. Alternative Income Deﬁnitions. In rows 5–8 of Table I, we
explore the robustness of the baseline rank-rank estimate to al-
ternative deﬁnitions of child and parent income. In row 5, we
verify that the missing W-2 data from 1996 to 1998 does not
create signiﬁcant bias by deﬁning parent income as mean
income from 1999 to 2003. The rank-rank estimates are virtually
unchanged with this redeﬁnition.
In row 6, we deﬁne the parent’s rank based on the individual
income of the parent with higher mean income from 1999
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

to 2003.29 This speciﬁcation eliminates the mechanical variation
in family income driven by the number of parents in the house-
hold, which could overstate the persistence of income across gen-
erations if parent marital status has a direct effect of children’s
outcomes. The rank-rank correlation falls by approximately
10 percent, from 0.341 to 0.312 when we use top parent income.
The impact of using individual parent income instead of family
income is modest because (i) most of the variation in parent
income across households is not due to differences in marital
status and (ii) the mean ranks of children with married parents
are only 4.6 percentile points higher than those with single
parents.
Next, we consider alternative income deﬁnitions for the chil-
dren. Here, one concern is that children of higher income parents
may be more likely to marry, again exaggerating the observed
persistence in family income relative to individual income.
Using individual income to measure the child’s rank has differ-
ential impacts by the child’s gender, consistent with Chadwick
and Solon (2002). For male children, using individual income in-
stead of family income reduces the rank-rank correlation from
0.336 in the baseline speciﬁcation to 0.317, a 6 percent reduction.
For female children, using individual income reduces the rank-
rank correlation from 0.346 to 0.257, a 26 percent reduction. The
change may be larger for women because women from high
income families tend to marry high-income men and may
choose not to work.
Finally, in row 8 of Table I, we deﬁne a measure of child
income that excludes capital and other nonlabor income using
the
sum
of
individual
wage
earnings,
UI
beneﬁts,
SSDI
beneﬁts, and Schedule C self-employment income. We divide
self-employment income by two for married individuals. This
individual earnings measure also yields virtually identical esti-
mates of the rank-rank slope.
29. We use 1999–2003 income here because we cannot allocate earnings across
spouses before 1999, as W-2 forms are available starting only in 1999. Note that top
income rank differs from family income rank even for single parents because some
individuals get married in subsequent years and because these individuals are
ranked relative to the population, not relative to other single individuals.

Gradients of College Attendance and Teenage Birth by Parent Rank
These ﬁgures present nonparametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between children’s college attendance rates (Panel A,
circles), college quality rank (Panel A, triangles), and teenage birth rates (Panel B) versus parents’ percentile rank. Both ﬁgures are
based on the core sample (1980–1982 birth cohorts). Parent rank is deﬁned based on mean family income from 1996 to 2000. In Panel
A, the circles plot the fraction of children ever attending college between age 18–21 within each parent-income percentile bin; the
triangles plot the average college quality rank at age 20 within each parent-income percentile bin. College attendance is deﬁned as the
presence of a 1098-T form ﬁled by a college on behalf of the student. College quality rank is deﬁned as the percentile rank of the college
that the child attends at age 20 based on the mean earnings at age 31 of children who attended the same college (children who do not
attend college are included in a separate ‘‘no college’’ group); see Section III.B for further details. Panel B plots the fraction of female
children who give birth while teenagers within each parental percentile bin. Having a teenage birth is deﬁned as ever claiming a
dependent child who was born while the mother was aged 13–19. The slopes and best-ﬁt lines for college attendance and teenage birth
are estimated using linear regressions of the outcome of interest on parent income rank in the microdata. We regress college quality
rank on a quadratic in parent rank to match the nonlinearity of the relationship. The college quality gradient is deﬁned as the
difference between the ﬁtted values for children with parents at the 75th percentile and parents at the 25th percentile using this
quadratic speciﬁcation.

We supplement our analysis of intergenerational income mo-
bility by studying the relationship between parent income and
two intermediate outcomes for children: college attendance and
teenage birth.
The series in circles in Figure IV Panel A presents a binned
scatter plot of the college attendance rate of children versus the
percentile rank of parent family income using the core sample.
College attendance is deﬁned as attending college in one or more
years between the ages 18 and 21. The relationship between col-
lege attendance rates and parental income rank is again virtually
linear, with a slope of 0.675. That is, moving from the lowest-
income to highest-income parents increases the college atten-
dance rate by 67.5 percentage points, similar to the estimates
reported by Bailey and Dynarski (2011) using survey data.
The series in triangles in Figure IV Panel A plots college
quality ranks versus parent ranks. We deﬁne a child’s college
quality rank based on the mean earnings at age 30 of students
who attended each college at age 20. The 54 percent of children
who do not attend college at age 20 are included in this analysis
and are assigned the mean rank for the noncollege group, which
is approximately 54
2 ¼ 27 (see Section III.B for details). The rela-
tionship between college quality rank and parent income rank is
convex because most children from low-income families do not
attend college, and hence increases in parent income have little
impact on college quality rank at the bottom. To account for this
non-linearity, we regress college quality ranks on a quadratic
function of parent income rank and deﬁne the gradient in college
quality as the difference in the predicted college quality rank for
children with parents at the 75th percentile and children with
parents at the 25th percentile. The P25–75 gap in college quality
ranks is 19.1 percentiles in our core sample.
Figure IV Panel B plots teenage birth rates for female chil-
dren versus parent income ranks. Teenage birth is deﬁned (for
females only) as having a child when the mother is aged 13–19.
There is a 29.8 percentage point gap in teenage birth rates be-
tween children from the highest- and lowest-income families.
These correlations between intermediate outcomes and
parent income ranks do not vary signiﬁcantly across subsam-
ples or birth cohorts, as shown in rows 9–11 of Table I. The

strength of these correlations indicates that much of the diver-
gence between children from low- versus high-income families
emerges well before they enter the labor market, consistent
with the ﬁndings of prior work (such as Neal and Johnson
1996;
Cameron
and
Heckman
2001;
Bhattacharya
and
Mazumder 2011).
V. Spatial Variation in Mobility
We now turn to our central goal of characterizing the varia-
tion in intergenerational mobility across areas within the United
States. We begin by deﬁning measures of geographic location. We
then present estimates of relative and absolute mobility by area
and assess the robustness of these estimates to alternative
speciﬁcations.
V.A.
Geographical Units
To characterize the variation in children’s outcomes across
areas, one must ﬁrst partition the United States into a set of
geographical areas in which children grow up. One way to con-
ceptualize the choice of a geographical partition is using a hier-
archical model in which children’s outcomes depend on conditions
in their immediate neighborhood (such as peers or resources in
their city block), local community (such as the quality of schools in
their county), and broader metro area (such as local labor market
conditions). To fully characterize the geography of intergenera-
tional mobility, one would ideally estimate all of the components
of such a hierarchical model.
As a ﬁrst step toward this goal, we characterize intergenera-
tional mobility at the level of commuting zones. CZs are aggrega-
tions of counties based on commuting patterns in the 1990 census
constructed by Tolbert and Sizer (1996) and introduced to the
economics literature by Dorn (2009). Since CZs are designed to
span the area in which people live and work, they provide a nat-
ural starting point as the coarsest partition of areas. CZs are
similar to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), but unlike
MSAs, they cover the entire United States, including rural
areas. There are 741 CZs in the United States; on average, each
CZ contains four counties and has a population of 380,000. See
Online Appendix Figure III for an illustration of the Boston CZ.

We focus on CZ-level variation because mobility statistics in
very small neighborhoods are likely to be heavily affected by sort-
ing. Because property prices are typically homogeneous within
narrow areas and home values are highly correlated with
parent income, comparisons within a small neighborhood effec-
tively condition on a proxy for parent income. As a result, the
variation in parent income across individuals in a small area
(such as a city block) must be correlated with other latent factors
that could affect children’s outcomes directly, making it difﬁcult
to interpret the resulting mobility estimates.30 Nevertheless, to
obtain some insight into within-CZ variation, we also report sta-
tistics on intergenerational mobility by county in Online Data
Table III. There is almost as much variance in intergenerational
mobility across counties within a CZ as there is across CZs, sug-
gesting that the total amount of geographical variation may be
even greater than that documented below.31
We permanently assign each child to a single CZ based on the
ZIP code from which his or his parent ﬁled their tax return in the
ﬁrst year the child was claimed as a dependent. We interpret this
CZ as the area where a child grew up. Because our data begin in
1996, location is measured in 1996 for 95.9% of children in our
core sample.32 For children in our core sample of 1980–1982 birth
cohorts, we therefore typically measure location when children
were approximately 15 years old. For the children in the more
recent birth cohorts in our extended sample, location is measured
at earlier ages. Using these more recent cohorts, we ﬁnd that
83.5 percent of children live in the same CZ at age 16 as they
did at age 5. Furthermore, we verify that the spatial patterns
for the outcomes we can measure at earlier ages (college
30. For example, it would be difﬁcult toestimate the degree ofintergenerational
mobility on Park Avenue in Manhattan because any families with low observed
income in such a high-property-value area would have to be latently wealthy to be
able to afford to live there.
31. We also report statistics by MSA in Online Data Table IV. For CZs that
intersect MSAs, correlations between CZ-level and MSA-level mobility statistics
exceed 0.9.
32. Location is measured after 1996 for approximately 3% of children because
they were linked to parents based on tax returns ﬁled after 1996. We have no in-
formation on location for the remaining 1% of children in the national sample be-
causethe ZIPcode listedontheparent’staxreturnsisinvalidormissing(seeOnline

Intergenerational Mobility in Selected Commuting Zones
These ﬁgures present nonparametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between child and parent income ranks in selected
CZs. Both panels are based on the core sample (1980–1982 birth cohorts) and baseline family income deﬁnitions for parents and
children. Children are assigned to CZs based on the location of their parents (when the child was claimed as a dependent), irrespective
of where they live as adults. Parent and child percentile ranks are always deﬁned at the national level, not the CZ level. To construct
each series, we group parents into 50 equally sized (2 percentile point) bins and plot the mean child percentile rank versus the mean
parent percentile rank within each bin. We report two measures of mobility based on the rank-rank relationships in each CZ. The ﬁrst
is relative mobility (r100  r0), which is 100 times the rank-rank slope estimate. The second is absolute upward mobility (r25), the
predicted child income rank at the 25th percentile of parent income distribution, depicted by the dashed vertical line in the ﬁgures. All
mobility statistics and best-ﬁt lines are estimated on the underlying microdata (not the binned means).

attendance and teenage birth) are similar if we deﬁne CZs based
on location at age 5 instead of age 16.
The CZ where a child grew up does not necessarily corre-
spond to the CZ he lives in as an adult when we measure his
income (at age 30) in 2011–2012. In our core sample, 38% of chil-
dren live in a different CZ in 2012 relative to where they grew up.
V.B.
Measures of Relative and Absolute Mobility
In our baseline analysis, we measure mobility at the CZ level
using the core sample (1980–1982 birth cohorts) and the deﬁni-
tions of parent and child family income described in Section III.B.
Importantly, we continue to rank both children and parents
based on their positions in the national income distribution
(rather than the distribution within their CZ).
We begin by examining the rank-rank relationship in se-
lected CZs. Figure V Panel A presents a binned scatter plot of
the mean child rank versus parent rank for children who grew
up in the Salt Lake City, UT (circles), or Charlotte, NC (trian-
gles), CZs. The rank-rank relationship is virtually linear in these
CZs. The linearity of the rank-rank relationship is a remarkably
robust property across CZs, as illustrated for the 20 largest CZs in
Online Appendix Figure IV.
Exploiting this approximate linearity, we summarize the
conditional expectation of a child’s rank given his parents’
rank in each CZ using two parameters: a slope and an intercept.
Let Ric denote the national income rank (among children in
his birth cohort) of child i who grew up in CZ c. Similarly,
let Pic denote his parent’s rank in the income distribution of
parents in the core sample. We estimate the slope and intercept
of the rank-rank relationship in CZ c by regressing child rank on
parent rank:
Ric ¼ c þ cPic þ "ic:
ð2Þ
The slope of the rank-rank relationship (c) in equation (2) mea-
sures degree of relative mobility in CZ c, as deﬁned in Section II.
In Salt Lake City, c ¼ 0.264.33 The difference between the ex-
pected ranks of children born to parents at the top and bottom
of the income distribution is r100;c  r0;c ¼ 100 c ¼ 26:4 in Salt
Lake City. There is much less relative mobility (i.e., much greater
33. We always measure percentile ranks on a 0–100 scale and slopes on a 0–1
scale, so c ranges from 0 to 100 and c ranges from 0 to 1 in equation (3).

persistence of income across generations) in Charlotte, where
r100  r0 ¼ 39:7.
Following the discussion in Section II, we deﬁne absolute
mobility at percentile p in CZ c as the expected rank of a child
who grew up in CZ c with parents who have a national income
rank of p:
rpc ¼ c þ cp:
ð3Þ
We focus much of our analysis on average absolute mobility for
children from families with below-median parent income in the
national distribution (E[RicjPic< 50]), which we call absolute up-
ward mobility.34 Because the rank-rank relationship is linear, the
average rank of children with below-median parent income equals
the average rank of children with parents at the 25th percentile in
the national distribution (r25;c ¼ c þ 25c), illustrated by the
dashed vertical line in Figure V Panel A. Absolute upward mobility
is r25 ¼ 46:2 in Salt Lake City, compared with r25 ¼ 35:8 in
Charlotte. That is, among families earning $28,800—the 25th per-
centile of the national parent family income distribution—children
who grew up in Salt Lake City are on average 10 percentile points
higher in their birth cohort’s income distribution at age 30 than are
children who grew up in Charlotte.
Absolute mobility is higher in Salt Lake City not just for below-
median families, but at all percentiles p of the parent income dis-
tribution. The gap in absolute outcomes is largest at the bottom of
the income distribution and nearly zero at the top. Hence, the
greater relative mobility in this particular comparison comes
purely from better absolute outcomes at the bottom of the distri-
bution rather than worse outcomes at the top. Of course, this is
not always the case. Figure V Panel B shows that San Francisco
has
substantially
higher
relative
mobility
than
Chicago:
r100  r0 ¼ 25:0 in San Francisco versus r100  r0 ¼ 39:3 in
Chicago. But part of the greater relative mobility in San
34. We integrate over the national parent income distribution rather than the
local distribution when deﬁning E[RicjPic < 50] to ensure that our cross-CZ com-
parisons are not affected by differences in local income distributions. We focus on
the absolute outcomes of children from low-income families both because the out-
comes of disadvantaged youth are a central focus of policy interest and because
there is more variation across areas in the outcomes of children from low-income
families than those from high-income families, as we show in Figure VII. However,
the CZ-level statistics in Online Data Tables V and VI can be used to analyze spatial
variation in the outcomes of children from high-income families.

FIGURE VI
The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility
These ﬁgures present heat maps of our two baseline measures of interge-
nerational mobility by CZ. Both ﬁgures are based on the core sample (1980–
1982 birth cohorts) and baseline family income deﬁnitions for parents and
children. Children are assigned to CZs based on the location of their parents
(when the child was claimed as a dependent), irrespective of where they live as
adults. In each CZ, we regress child income rank on a constant and parent
income rank. Using the regression estimates, we deﬁne absolute upward mo-
bility (r25) as the intercept þ 25  (rank-rank slope), which corresponds to the
predicted child rank given parent income at the 25th percentile (see Figure V).
We deﬁne relative mobility as the rank-rank slope; the difference between the
outcomes of the child from the richest and poorest family is 100 times this
coefﬁcient (r100  r0). The maps are constructed by grouping CZs into 10 deciles
and shading the areas so that lighter colors correspond to higher absolute mo-
bility (Panel A) and lower rank-rank slopes (Panel B). Areas with fewer than
250 children in the core sample, for which we have inadequate data to estimate
mobility, are shaded with the cross-hatch pattern. In Panel B, we report the
unweighted and population-weighted correlation coefﬁcients between relative
mobility and absolute mobility across CZs. The CZ-level statistics underlying
these ﬁgures are reported in Online Data Table V.

Francisco comes from worse outcomes for children from high-
income families. Below the 60th percentile, children in San
Francisco have better outcomes than those in Chicago; above the
60th percentile, the reverse is true.
The comparisons in Figure V illustrate the importance of
measuring both relative and absolute mobility. Any social welfare
function based on mean income ranks that respects the Pareto
principle would rate Salt Lake City above Charlotte. But norma-
tive comparisons of San Francisco and Chicago depend on the
weight one puts on relative versus absolute mobility (or, equiva-
lently, on the weights one places on absolute mobility at each
percentile p).
V.C.
Baseline Estimates by CZ
We estimate equation (2) using OLS to calculate absolute
upward mobility (r25;c ¼ c þ 25c) and relative mobility (c) by
CZ. The estimates for each CZ are reported in Online Data Table V.
1. Absolute Upward Mobility. Figure VI Panel A presents a
heat map of absolute upward mobility. We construct this map by
dividing CZs into deciles based on their estimated value of r25;c.
Lighter colors represent deciles with higher levels of r25;c.35
Upward mobility varies signiﬁcantly across areas. CZs in the top
decile have r25;c > 52.0, whereas those in the bottom decile have
r25;c < 37:4. Note that the 37th percentile of the family income dis-
tribution for children at age 30 is $22,900, whereas the 52nd per-
centile is $35,500; hence, the difference in upward mobility across
areas translates to substantial differences in children’s incomes.
Pooling all CZs, the unweighted standard deviation of r25;c is
5.68; the population-weighted standard deviation is 3.34. The un-
conditional standard deviation of children’s income ranks (which
have a uniform distribution) is 100ﬃﬃﬃﬃ

¼ 28:9. Hence, a 1 standard
35. We cannot estimate mobility for 32 CZs in which we have fewer than 250
children in the core sample, shown by the cross-hatched areas in the maps in
Figure VI. These CZs account for less than 0.05% of the U.S. population in the
2000 census. In Online Appendix Figure V, we present a version of this map in
which we use data from the 1980–1985 cohorts to estimate mobility for the CZs
that have fewer than 250 observations in the core (1980–1982) sample. The esti-
mates of mobility in the CZs with missing data are quite similar to those in neigh-
boring CZs, consistent with the spatial autocorrelation evident in the rest of the
map.

deviation improvement in CZ ‘‘quality’’—as measured by its level
of absolute upward mobility r25;c—is associated with a 5:68
2:89 ¼ 0:20
standard deviation increase in the expected income rank of chil-
dren whose parents are at the 25th percentile.36 For comparison,
a 1 standard deviation increase in parent income rank is associ-
ated with a 0.34 standard deviation increase in a child’s income
rank (Figure II Panel A). Hence, a 1 standard deviation improve-
ment in CZ quality is associated with 60 percent as large an in-
crease in a child’s income as a 1 standard deviation increase in his
own parent’s income.
There are three broad spatial patterns in upward mobility
evident in Figure VI Panel A. First, upward mobility varies sub-
stantially at the regional level. Upward mobility is lowest in the
Southeast and highest in the Great Plains. The West Coast and
Northeast also have high rates of upward mobility, though not as
high as the Great Plains.
Second, there is substantial within-region variation as well.
Using unweighted CZ-level regressions of the upward mobility
estimates on census division and state ﬁxed effects, we estimate
that 53 percent of the cross-CZ variance in absolute upward mo-
bility is within the nine census divisions and 36 percent is within
states. For example, many parts of Texas exhibit relatively high
rates of upward mobility, unlike much of the rest of the South.
Ohio exhibits much lower rates of upward mobility than nearby
Pennsylvania. The statistics also pick up much more granular
variation in upward mobility. For example, South Dakota gener-
ally exhibits very high levels of upward mobility, with the excep-
tion of a few areas in the southwest corner of the state. These
areas are some of the largest Native American reservations in the
United States and are well known to suffer from very high rates of
persistent poverty.
The third generic pattern is that urban areas tend to exhibit
lower levels of intergenerational mobility than rural areas on
36. An analogous calculation using the estimates of college attendance gradi-
entsby CZinSection IV.C impliesthata1 standard deviation increase inCZquality
is associated with a 0.19 standard deviation (9.3 percentage point) increase in col-
lege attendance rates for children with parents at the 25th percentile. Using data
from the PSID, Solon, Page, and Duncan (2002, p. 390) estimate that a 1 standard
deviation increase in neighborhood quality is associated with a 0.32 standard de-
viation increase in years of education. We ﬁnd less variation in outcomes across
neighborhoods presumably because commuting zones are much larger than the
PSID sampling clusters analyzed by Solon, Page, and Duncan.

average. For instance, children from low-income families who
grow up in the Chicago area have signiﬁcantly lower incomes at
age 30 than those who grow up in rural areas in Illinois. On av-
erage, urban areas—which we deﬁne as CZs that intersect
MSAs—have upward mobility of r25;c ¼ 41:7, wheras rural
areas have r25;c ¼ 45:8. In interpreting this comparison, it is im-
portant to recall that our deﬁnition of geography is based on
where children grew up, not where they live as adults. Of children
who grow up in rural areas, 44.6% live in urban areas at age 30.
Among those who rose from the bottom quintile of the national
income distribution to the top quintile, 55.2 percent of children
who grew up in rural areas live in urban areas at age 30.
Table III shows statistics on intergenerational mobility for
the 50 largest CZs by population. Among these cities, absolute
upward mobility ranges from 46.2 in the Salt Lake City area to
35.8 in Charlotte (column (4)). There is considerable variation
even between nearby cities: Pittsburgh is ranked second in
terms of upward mobility among large metro areas, while
Cleveland—approximately 100 miles away—is ranked in the
bottom 10. Upward mobility is especially low in certain cities in

Notes. This table reports estimates of intergenerational mobility for the 50 largest CZs according to
their populations in the 2000 census. The CZs are sorted in descending order by absolute upward mobility
(column (4)). The mobility measures are calculated using the core sample (1980–1982 birth cohorts) and
the baseline family income deﬁnitions described in Table I (except for column (5), which uses the 1980–
1985 birth cohorts). The measures in columns (4) and (7) are both derived from within-CZ OLS regressions
of child income rank against parent income rank. Column (7) reports the slope coefﬁcient from this
regression, which is equal to the difference in mean child income rank between children with parents
in the 100th percentile and children with parents in the 0th percentile (divided by 100). Column (4)
reports the predicted value at parent income rank equal to 25. Column (5) reports the percentage of
children whose family income is in the top quintile of the national distribution of child family income
conditional on having parent family income in the bottom quintile of the parental national income distri-
bution. These probabilities are taken directly from Online Data Table VII. Column (6) reports the ﬁtted
values at parent rank 25 from a regression of an indicator for child family income being above the poverty
line on parent income rank (see Online Appendix F for details). See Online Data Table V for estimates for
all CZs as well as estimates using alternative samples and income deﬁnitions.

the Rust Belt, such as Indianapolis and Columbus and cities in
the Southeast such as Atlanta and Raleigh. The fact that children
who grow up in low-income families in Atlanta and Raleigh fare
poorly is especially noteworthy because these are generally con-
sidered to be booming cities in the South with relatively high
rates of job growth.
In column (5) of Table III, we consider an alternative measure
of upward mobility: the probability that a child born to a family in
the bottom quintile of the national income distribution reaches the
top quintile of the national income distribution.37 To improve pre-
cision in smaller CZs, we estimate this probability pooling the
1980–1985 birth cohorts.38 The ranking of areas based on this sta-
tistic is similar to that based on the mean rank measure of upward
mobility. The probability that a child from the lowest quintile of
parental income rises to the top quintile is 10.8% in Salt Lake City,
compared with 4.4% in Charlotte. The city with the highest prob-
ability of moving from the bottom ﬁfth to the top ﬁfth is San Jose,
where the probability (12.9%) is nearly three times that in
Charlotte. The chances of rising from the bottom ﬁfth to the top
ﬁfth for children growing up in San Jose are comparable to those in
Denmark and Canada (see Section IV.A). Note that if parent
income played no role in determining children’s outcomes, all the
quintile transition probabilities would be 20%. Hence, the varia-
tion in rates of upward mobility across areas is large relative to the
maximum plausible range of 0 to 20%.
In column (6) of Table III, we consider another measure of
absolute upward mobility: the probability that a child has family
income above the poverty line conditional on having parents at
37. In principle, differences in local income distributions within the bottom
quintile could generate differences in this probability. In an earlier version of
this analysis (v1.0 available on the project website, www.equality-of-opportunity.
org), we accounted for these differences by calculating the chance of reaching the
top quintile separately for each percentile and computed the unweighted mean
across the percentiles, effectively integrating over the national parent income dis-
tribution. The adjusted CZ-level transition probabilities obtained using this ap-
proach were virtually identical to the raw transition probabilities we report in
this article.
38. We verify that including more recent cohorts does not generate signiﬁcant
bias by showing that the national transition matrix based on the 1980–1985 cohorts
(Online Appendix Table VI) is virtually identical to the matrix based on the 1980–
1982 cohorts in Table II. We report the quintile transition matrix for each CZ
in Online Data Table VI and provide statistics on the marginal distributions of
parent and child income by CZ in Online Data Table VII.

the 25th percentile (see Online Appendix F for details on the con-
struction of this measure). This statistic also generates very sim-
ilar rankings across CZs, conﬁrming that our results are not
sensitive to the way we measure upward mobility.
2. Relative Mobility. Figure VI Panel B presents a heat map of
relative mobility. This map is constructed in the same way as
Panel A, dividing CZs into deciles based on the rank-rank slope
c. In this map, lighter areas denote areas with greater relative
mobility (lower c). Relative mobility also varies substantially
across areas. The expected rank of children from the richest
versus poorest families differs by more than 40.2 percentiles in
CZs in the bottom decile of relative mobility. The corresponding
gap is less than 23.5 percentiles for CZs in the top decile.
The geographical patterns in relative mobility in Panel B are
similar to those for absolute upward mobility in Panel A. The
unweighted correlation across CZs between the two measures is
0.68; the population-weighted correlation is 0.61. This indi-
cates that areas with greater relative mobility tend to have
better absolute outcomes for children from low-income families.
To investigate the connection between absolute and relative
mobility more systematically, let pc ¼ E[RicjPic ¼ p] denote a
child’s expected rank given a parent rank of p in CZ c. We esti-
mate pc in each CZ nonparametrically as the mean value of Ric
for children in each percentile bin of the parent income distribu-
tion p ¼ 0, . . . , 99.39 For each of the 100 values of p, we estimate an
unweighted OLS regression of pc on relative mobility c with one
observation per CZ:
pc ¼ a þ pc þ pc:
In this equation, p measures the association across CZs
between a 1 unit increase in c (i.e., greater intergenerational
39. The expected value pc differs from rpc deﬁned above because pc is esti-
mated nonparametrically using only data in percentile bin p, whereas rpc is cal-
culated based on the linear approximation to the rank-rank relationship in
equation (3). In practice, the two estimates are extremely similar. For instance,
in the 100 largest CZs, where pc is estimated with very little error, the correlation
between pc and rpc exceeds 0.99. We use the linear approximation rpc in most of
our analysis to obtain more precise estimates of absolute mobility in smaller CZs.
However, because the goal of the exercise here is to evaluate the relationship
between relative mobility c and absolute mobility at each percentile nonparame-
trically, we use pc here.

FIGURE VII
Relationship between Absolute and Relative Mobility
These ﬁgures illustrate the correlation between relative mobility and absolute mobility at various percentiles of the income dis-
tribution. To construct Panel A, we ﬁrst calculate the mean income rank of children in CZ c with parents in (national) percentile p,
denoted by pc. We then run a CZ-level regression of pc on relative mobility (r100c  r0c) at each percentile p separately. Panel A plots
the resulting regression coefﬁcients p versus the percentile p. The coefﬁcient p can be interpreted as the mean impact of a 1 unit
increase in relative mobility on the absolute outcomes of children whose parents are at percentile p. We also plot the best linear ﬁt
across the 100 coefﬁcients. This line, estimated using an OLS regression, crosses 0 at percentile p ¼ 85.1. This implies that increases in
relative mobility are associated with higher expected rank outcomes for children with parents below percentile 85.1 and lower expected
rank outcomes for children with parents above percentile 85.1. To illustrate the intuition for this result, Panel B plots hypothetical
rank-rank relationships in two representative CZs, one of which has more relative mobility than the other. Panel A implies that in
such a pairwise comparison, the two rank-rank relationships cross at the 85th percentile on average, as illustrated in Panel B.

persistence) and the mean rank of children with parents at the p-
th percentile of the national income distribution. A negative
coefﬁcient (^ p < 0) implies that CZs with greater relative mobility
generate better mean outcomes for children with parents at
percentile p.
Figure VII Panel A plots the coefﬁcients ^ p at each parent
income percentile p along with a linear ﬁt to the coefﬁcients. The
coefﬁcients ^ p are increasing with p: CZs with greater relative
mobility (lower c) produce better outcomes for children from
lower income families. The best linear ﬁt crosses 0 at p ¼ 85.1.
Hence, increases in relative mobility are associated with better
outcomes for children who grow up in families below the 85th
percentile on average. For families at the 85th percentile, differ-
ences in relative mobility across CZs are uncorrelated with a
child’s mean rank. For families in the top 15%, living in a CZ
with greater relative mobility is associated with worse outcomes
on average for children. Observe that p reaches only 0.2 for the
richest families but is nearly 0.8 for the poorest families. This
shows that differences in relative mobility across CZs are associ-
ated with much larger differences in absolute mobility for chil-
dren from low-income families than high-income families.40
Figure VII Panel B presents a schematic that illustrates the
intuition underlying the preceding results. This ﬁgure plots hy-
pothetical rank-rank relationships in two representative CZs, one
of which has more relative mobility than the other. Figure VII
Panel A implies that in such a pairwise comparison, the rank-
rank relationship ‘‘pivots’’ at the 85th percentile on average. This
is why the spatial patterns of absolute mobility at p ¼ 25 and
relative mobility in Figure VI look similar.
Because the pivot point is high in the income distribution,

in Figure VII Panel A would be perfectly linear and 100 – 0 ¼ 1 mechanically. The
slight deviation from linearity at the bottom of the distribution evident in Figure V
generates the slight deviation of 100 – 0 from 1.
41. It bears emphasis that this result applies to percentile ranks rather than
mean income levels. Because the income distribution has a thick upper tail, a given
difference in percentile ranks translates to a much larger difference in mean in-
comes in the upper tail of the income distribution. The probability that children of

differences in relative mobility across areas are caused by differ-
ences in local policies, this result suggests that policies that im-
prove relative mobility may be able to improve the outcomes of
children from poor families without hurting children from high-
income families signiﬁcantly.
V.D.
Robustness of Spatial Patterns
We assess the robustness of the spatial patterns in mobility
along several dimensions. The results of this robustness analysis
are reported in Online Appendix F and Appendix Table VII; we
present a brief summary here.
We begin by considering changes in sample deﬁnitions: lim-
iting the sample to male versus female children, married versus
single parents, and later birth cohorts (for which we measure
children’s location at earlier ages). Measures of both absolute
and relative mobility across areas in these subsamples generally
have a correlation of more than 0.9 with the corresponding base-
line measures reported above. Restricting the sample to hold the
parents’ ages at the birth of child ﬁxed, limiting the sample to
children who stay in the CZ where they grew up as adults, and
limiting the sample to children linked to only one parent in all
years yield very similar estimates of mobility across areas.
We also ﬁnd that the spatial patterns are highly robust to
using alternative measures of income used in Table I. For exam-
ple, using individual income instead of family income or wage
earnings instead of total income yields very spatial patterns.
We evaluate whether adjusting for differences in cost-of-
living across areas affects our estimates by dividing parents’
income by a local price index (based on the ACCRA survey) for
the CZ where their child grew up and the child’s income by the
price index for the CZ where he lives in 2012 to obtain real income
measures. Measures of intergenerational mobility based on real
incomes are very highly correlated with our baseline measures.
The degree of upward mobility—that is, the difference between
the child’s rank and the parent’s rank—is essentially unaffected
by adjusting for local prices because few children move to areas
with very different levels of cost of living relative to their parents
(see Online Appendix F for details).
afﬂuent parents become very high-income ‘‘superstars’’ may therefore differ signif-
icantly across areas.

Because we measure parent income before 2000 and child
income in 2011–2012, part of the variation in upward mobility
across areas could be driven by shocks to local economic growth.
While growth shocks—for example, from the discovery of a natu-
ral resource such as oil—are a real source of upward mobility, one
may be interested in isolating variation in mobility attributable
to more stable factors that can be manipulated by policy. We
assess the extent to which economic growth is responsible for
the spatial variation in upward mobility in two ways. First, we
deﬁne parent income as mean family income in 2011–2012, the
same years in which we measure child income. Insofar as local
economic growth raises the incomes of both parents and children,
this measure nets out the effects of growth on mobility. Second,
we regress upward mobility on the CZ-level growth rate from
2000 to 2010 and calculate residuals. Both of these growth-ad-
justed mobility measures have a correlation of more than 0.8 with
our baseline measures, indicating that most of the spatial varia-
tion in upward mobility is not driven by differences in growth
rates.
Finally, we consider a set of alternative statistics for relative
and absolute mobility. Estimating relative mobility based on
parent and child ranks in the local income distribution yields
estimates that are very highly correlated with our baseline esti-
mates based on national ranks. We also show that the two alter-
native measures of upward mobility analyzed in Table III—the
probability of rising from the bottom ﬁfth to the top ﬁfth and the
probability of having income above the poverty line conditional on
having parents at the 25th percentile – also generate very similar
spatial patterns, with correlations above 0.9 with our baseline
mean rank measure of upward mobility (Online Appendix
Figure VI).

Intermediate Outcomes: College Attendance and Teenage
Birth
To better understand the sources of the spatial variation in
intergenerational income mobility, we characterize spatial vari-
ation in the three intermediate outcomes analyzed in Figure IV:
college attendance rates, college quality rank, and teenage birth
rates. We ﬁrst regress each of these outcomes on parent na-
tional income rank in each CZ c using speciﬁcations analogous
to equation (2). We then characterize spatial variation in two

measures of mobility for each outcome using the regression esti-
mates: the slope coefﬁcient, which is analogous to our measure of
relative mobility, and the predicted outcome for children with
parents at the 25th percentile, which is analogous to our measure
of absolute mobility.42
We present heat maps for the relative and absolute mobility
measures
for
the
three
intermediate
outcomes
in
Online
Appendix Figures VII–IX; the CZ-level data underlying these
maps are reported in Online Data Table V. There is substantial
spatial variation in all three intermediate outcomes and the var-
iation is highly correlated with the variation in the intergenera-
tional income mobility. For example, college attendance rates for
children with parents at the 25th percentile vary from less than
32.4% in bottom decile of CZs to more than 55.6% in the top decile
of CZs. The unweighted correlation between college attendance
rates at the 25th percentile and mean income ranks at the
25th percentile (absolute upward mobility) across CZs is 0.71
(Online Appendix Table VII, row 23). Similarly, teenage birth
rates for female children whose parents are at the 25th percentile
vary from less than 15.4% in the bottom decile of CZs to more
than 29.4% in the top decile. The correlation between teen birth
rates and absolute upward mobility is 0.61.
An important implication of these results is that much of the
difference in intergenerational mobility across areas emerges
while children are teenagers, well before they enter the labor
market as adults.43 This suggests that the spatial variation in
income mobility is driven by factors that either directly affect
children at early ages (such as the quality of schools or social
structure) or anticipatory behavioral responses to subsequent dif-
ferences (such as returns to education in the local labor market).
We explore mechanisms that have such properties in the next
section.
42. Because the relationship between college quality rank and parent rank is
not linear, weregress collegequality ranks on a quadratic functionofparent income
rank and deﬁne the relative mobility measure for college quality as the difference in
the predicted college quality rank for children with parents at the 75th percentile
and children with parents at the 25th percentile, as in Figure IV Panel A.
43. Further supporting this claim, we ﬁnd a strong positive correlation of 0.63
between teenage labor force participation rates (between the ages of 14 and 16) and
upward mobility (see Figure VIII and Online Appendix H).

VI. Correlates of Intergenerational Mobility
Why do some areas of the United States exhibit much higher
rates of upward mobility than others? As a ﬁrst step toward an-
swering this question, we correlate our measures of intergenera-
tional mobility with local area characteristics. Naturally, such
correlations cannot be interpreted as causal mechanisms. Our
goal is merely to document a set of stylized facts to guide the
search for causal determinants and the development of new
models of intergenerational mobility.
We correlate our mobility statistics with various factors that
have been discussed in the sociology and economics literature,
such as segregation and inequality. Because most of these factors
are slow-moving and we have estimates of intergenerational
income mobility for essentially one birth cohort, we focus on
cross-sectional correlations rather than changes over time. For
most covariates, we use data from the 2000 census and other
publicly available data sets because many variables cannot be
consistently measured in earlier years. See Online Appendix G
for details on the construction of the covariates analyzed in this
section and Online Data Table VIII for CZ-level data on each of
the covariates.
Figure VIII presents a summary of our correlational results. It
plots the unweighted univariate correlation between absolute
upward mobility and various CZ-level characteristics, using all
CZs with available data for the relevant variable. We consider sev-
eral proxies for each broad factor (segregation, inequality, etc.).
The dots show the point estimate of the correlation and the hori-
zontal lines show a 95 percent conﬁdence interval, based on stan-
dard errors clustered at the state level. The sign of the correlation is
shown in parentheses next to each variable. In Online Appendix
Table VIII, we report these correlations as well as estimates from
several alternative speciﬁcations including state ﬁxed effects,
weighting CZs by population, restricting to urban areas, and con-
trolling for differences in racial demographics and income growth
(see Online Appendix H for details). These alternative speciﬁca-
tions generally yield very similar results to the baseline estimates
shown in Figure VIII. Most important, the correlations discussed
below hold even in speciﬁcations with state ﬁxed effects, showing
that the results are not just driven by broad regional differences
across the South versus other parts of the country. We also show in
Online Appendix Table VIII that the factors that are positively

associated with absolute upward mobility are generally positively
associated with relative mobility (i.e., are negatively correlated
with rank-rank slopes).
In the remainder of this section, we discuss correlations of
mobility with the categories in Figure VIII that have the stron-
gest relationship with mobility: racial demographics, segregation,
income inequality, school quality, social capital, and family struc-
ture. We discuss results for four other broad categories for which
we ﬁnd weaker correlations – local tax policies, higher education,
labor market conditions, and migration – in Online Appendix H.
FIGURE VIII
Correlates of Spatial Variation in Upward Mobility
This ﬁgure shows the correlation of various CZ-level characteristics with
absolute upward mobility (r25) across CZs. For each characteristic listed on the
y-axis, the dot represents the absolute value of the unweighted correlation of
the variable with r25 across CZs. The horizontal bars show the 95% conﬁdence
interval based on standard errors clustered at state level. Positive correlations
are shown by (þ) on the y axis; negative correlations are shown by (–). We
consider covariates in 10 broad categories: racial demographics, segregation,
properties of the income distribution, K–12 education, social capital, family
structure, local tax policies, college education, labor market conditions, and
migration rates. The categories with the highest correlations are highlighted.
See column (1) of Appendix Table VII for the point estimates corresponding to
the correlations plotted here. See Section VI, Online Data Table IX, and Online
Appendix G for deﬁnitions of each of the correlates. CZ-level data on the covar-
iates used in this ﬁgure are reported in Online Data Table VIII.

VI.A.
Race
Perhaps the most obvious pattern from the maps in Figure VI
is that intergenerational mobility is lower in areas with larger
African American populations, such as the Southeast. Indeed, the
unweighted correlation between upward mobility and the frac-
tion of black residents in the CZ (based on the 2000 census) is
0.580, as shown in the ﬁrst row of Figure VIII.
This correlation could be driven by two very different chan-
nels. One channel is an individual-level race effect: black children
may have lower incomes than white children conditional on
parent income, and hence areas with a larger black population
may have lower upward mobility. An alternative possibility is a
place-level race effect: areas with large black populations might
have lower rates of upward mobility for children of all races.
To distinguish between these two channels, we would ideally
control for race at the individual level, essentially asking whether
whites have lower rates of upward mobility in areas with a larger
black population. Unfortunately, we do not observe each individ-
ual’s race in our data. As an alternative, we predict race based on
the parent’s ﬁve-digit ZIP code (in the year they ﬁrst claim their
child as a dependent). We use data from the 2000 census to mea-
sure racial shares by ZIP code. Figure IX Panel A replicates the
map of absolute upward mobility (r25;c) by CZ, restricting the
sample to ZIP codes within each CZ in which at least 80% of
the residents are non-Hispanic whites.44 In this subsample,
91% of individuals are white. The spatial pattern in Figure IX
Panel A is very similar to that in the original map for the full
sample in Figure VI Panel A. Most notably, even in this predom-
inantly white sample, rates of upward mobility remain low in the
Southeast and are much higher in the West. Among the 604 CZs
for which we are able to compute upward mobility measures for
predominantly white individuals, the unweighted correlation be-
tween upward mobility for the predominantly white sample and
the full sample is 0.91.
44. We continue to estimate r25;c at the CZ level in this map, but we only include
ZIP-5s within each CZ in which 80% or more of the residents are white. To facilitate
comparison to Figure VI, we color the entire CZ based on this statistic, including
ZIP-5s whose own white share is below 80%. CZs that have fewer than 250 children
who grew up in ZIP codes where more than 80% of the residents are white are
omitted (and shown with cross-hatch shading).

This ﬁgure replicates Figure VI Panel A, restricting the sample used to estimate the rank-rank regression in each CZ to parents living

(not just the ZIP codes used in the estimation) for comparability to other ﬁgures. CZs with fewer than 250 children living in ZIP codes
with > 80% white share are omitted and shaded with the cross-hatch pattern. We report the unweighted and population-weighted

25;c on r25;c, our baseline estimates of upward mobility based on the full sample,
using an unweighted OLS regression with one observation per CZ with available data. We vary w from 0% to 95% in increments of 5%
and plot the resulting regression coefﬁcients against the fraction of white individuals in each of the subsamples. The conﬁdence
interval, shown by the dotted lines around the point estimates, is based on standard errors clustered at the state level. The dashed
diagonal line shows the predicted relationship if there were no spatial heterogeneity in upward mobility conditional on race.

In Figure IX Panel B, we generalize this approach to assess
how the spatial pattern of upward mobility changes as we restrict
the sample to be increasingly white. To construct this ﬁgure, we
ﬁrst compute upward mobility in each CZ, restricting the sample
to individuals living in ZIP codes that are more than w% white,
which we denote by rw
25;c. We then regress rw
25;c on r25;c, our base-
line estimates of upward mobility based on the full sample, using
an unweighted OLS regression with one observation per CZ with
available data. We vary w from 0% to 95% in increments of 5%
and plot the resulting regression coefﬁcients in Figure IX Panel B
against the fraction of white individuals in each of the subsam-
ples. When w ¼ 0, the regression coefﬁcient is 1 by construction
because r25;c ¼ rw¼0
25;c . Since 68 percent of the U.S. population is
white, the ﬁrst point on the ﬁgure is (0.68, 1). The point generated
by the w ¼ 80% threshold is (0.91, 0.84), consistent with the map
in Figure IX Panel A. The dotted lines show a 95% conﬁdence
interval for the regression coefﬁcients based on standard errors
clustered at the state level.
If the variation in upward mobility across areas were entirely
driven by heterogeneity in outcomes across race at the individual
level, the coefﬁcient in Figure IX Panel B would fall to 0 as the
fraction white in the sample converged to 1, as illustrated by the
dashed line. Intuitively, if all of the spatial variation in Figure VI
Panel A were driven by individual-level differences in race, there
would be no spatial variation left in a purely white sample. The data
reject this hypothesis: even in the subsample with more than 95
percent white individuals, the regression coefﬁcient remains at 0.89.
The main lesson of this analysis is that both blacks and
whites living in areas with large African American populations
have lower rates of upward income mobility.45 There are many
potential mechanisms for such a correlation, including differ-
ences in the institutions and industries that developed in areas
with large African American populations. We are unable to dis-
tinguish between these mechanisms in our data; instead, we next
turn to one such mechanism that has received the greatest atten-
tion in prior work: segregation. The United States has a historical
legacy of greater segregation in areas with more blacks. Such
45. To be clear, this result does not imply that race does not matter for children’s
outcomes at the individual level, as shown, for example, by Mazumder (2011). Our
ﬁnding is simply that there is spatial heterogeneity in upward mobility even con-
ditional on race.

segregation could potentially affect both low-income whites and
blacks, as racial segregation is often associated with income
segregation.
VI.B.
Segregation
Prior work has argued that segregation has harmful effects
on
disadvantaged
individuals
through
various
channels:
reducing
exposure
to
successful
peers
and
role
models,
decreasing funding for local public goods such as schools, or ham-
pering access to nearby jobs (Wilson 1987; Massey and Denton
1993; Cutler and Glaeser 1997). In this section, we evaluate these
hypotheses by exploring the correlation between intergenera-
tional mobility and various measures of segregation (shown
in the second panel of Figure VIII and Online Appendix
Table VIII).
We begin by measuring racial segregation using a Theil
(1972) index, constructed using data from the 2000 census as
in Iceland (2004). Let r denote the fraction of individuals of
race r in a given CZ, with four racial groups: whites, blacks,
Hispanics, and others. We measure the level of racial diversity
in
the
CZ
by
an
entropy
index:
E ¼ P rlog2
1
r,
with
r
log2
1
r ¼ 0 when r ¼ 0. Letting j ¼ 1, . . . , N index census tracts
in the CZ, we analogously measure racial diversity within each
tract as Ej ¼ P rjlog2
1
rj where rj denotes the fraction of individ-
uals of race r in tract j. We deﬁne the degree of racial segregation
in the CZ as
H ¼
X
j
popj
poptotal
E  Ej
E


;
ð4Þ
where popj denotes the total population of tract j and poptotal
denotes the total population of the CZ. Intuitively, H measures
the extent to which the racial distribution in each census
tract deviates from the overall racial distribution in the CZ.
The segregation index H is maximized at H ¼ 1 when there is no
racial heterogeneity within census tracts, in which case Ej ¼ 0 in
all tracts. It is minimized at H(p) ¼ 0 when all tracts have racial
composition identical to the CZ as a whole, so that Ej ¼ E.
Column (1) of Table IV reports the coefﬁcient estimate from
an unweighted OLS regression of absolute upward mobility r25;c
on the racial segregation index, with one observation per CZ. In

this and all subsequent regressions, we standardize the depen-
dent variable and all independent variables to have mean 0 and
standard deviation 1 within the estimation sample. Hence, the
coefﬁcients in the univariate regressions can be interpreted as
correlation coefﬁcients. Standard errors are clustered by state
to account for spatial correlation across CZs.
More racially segregated areas have less upward mobility.
The unweighted correlation between upward mobility and the
racial segregation index in Column 1 is 0.361.46 Column (2)
shows that the correlation remains at 0.360 in urban areas,
that is, CZs that overlap with MSAs.

Notes. Each column reports coefﬁcients from an OLS regression with standard errors clustered at the
state level reported in parentheses. All independent and dependent variables are normalized (in the
relevant estimation sample) to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, so univariate regression coefﬁcients
equal correlation coefﬁcients. The regressions are run using data for the 709 CZs with at least 250 chil-
dren in the core sample. The dependent variable in all columns is our baseline measure of absolute
upward mobility, the expected rank of children whose parents are at the 25th national percentile.
Columns (2) and (5) restrict to the sample of CZs that intersect an MSA. Racial segregation is measured
by the Theil index deﬁned in Section VI.B using racial shares at the census tract level. Income segregation
is measured by a weighted average of two-group Theil indices, as in Reardon (2011). Segregation of
poverty is a two-group Theil index, where the groups are deﬁned as being above versus below the 25th
percentile of the local household income distribution. Segregation of afﬂuence is deﬁned analogously at the
75th percentile. Share with commute < 15 minutes is the fraction of working individuals in each CZ who
commute less than 15 minutes to work. See Online Appendix G for details on the deﬁnitions of the
independent variables.

Next, we turn to the relationship between income segrega-
tion and upward mobility. Following Reardon and Firebaugh
(2002) and Reardon (2011), we begin by measuring the degree
to which individuals below the p-th percentile of the local house-
hold income distribution are segregated from individuals above
the p-th percentile in each CZ using a two-group Theil index H(p).
Here, entropy in a given area is EðpÞ ¼ plog2
1
p þ ð1  pÞlog2
1
1p
and the index H(p) is deﬁned using the formula in equation (4).
Building on this measure, Reardon (2011) deﬁnes the overall level
of income segregation in a given CZ as
income segregation ¼ 2logð2Þ
Z
p
EðpÞHðpÞdp:
ð5Þ
This measure is simply a weighted average of segregation at each
percentile p, with greater weight placed on percentiles in the
middle of the income distribution, where entropy E(p) is maxi-
mized. We implement equation (5) using data from the 2000
census, which reports income binned in 16 categories. Following
Reardon (2011, Appendix 3), we measure H(p) at each of these
cutoffs and take a weighted sum of these values to calculate
income segregation.
In column (3) of Table IV, we regress absolute upward mobility
on the income segregation index; see Online Appendix Figure X
Panel B for the corresponding nonparametric binned scatter plot.
The correlation between income segregation and upward mobility
is 0.393, consistent with the ﬁndings of Graham and Sharkey
(2013) using survey data. Interestingly, areas with a larger black
population exhibit greater income segregation: the correlation be-
tween the fraction of black individuals in a CZ and the income
segregation index is 0.264 (std. err. 0.082). Hence, the negative
relationship between income segregation and upward mobility
could partly explain why low-income white children fare more
poorly in areas with large African American populations.
In column (4), we decompose the effects of segregation in
different parts of the income distribution. Following Reardon
and Bischoff (2011), we deﬁne the ‘‘segregation of poverty’’ as
H(p ¼ 25), that is, the extent to which individuals in the bottom
quartile are segregated from those above the 25th percentile. We
analogously deﬁne the segregation of afﬂuence as H(p ¼ 75).
Column (4) regresses upward mobility on both segregation of pov-
erty and afﬂuence. Segregation of poverty has a strong negative

association with upward mobility, whereas segregation of afﬂu-
ence does not. Column (5) shows that the same pattern holds
when restricting the sample to urban areas. These results
suggest
that
the
isolation
of
low-income
families
(rather
than the isolation of the rich) may be most detrimental for low-in-
come
children’s
prospects
of
moving
up
in
the
income
distribution.
Another mechanism by which segregation may diminish
upward mobility is through spatial mismatch in access to jobs
(Kain 1968; Kasarda 1989; Wilson 1996). We explore this mech-
anism in column (6) by correlating upward mobility with the frac-
tion of individuals who commute less than 15 minutes to work in
the CZ, based on data from the 2000 census. Areas with less
sprawl (shorter commutes) have signiﬁcantly higher rates of
upward mobility; the correlation between commute times and
upward mobility is 0.605. Column (7) shows that commute
times remain a signiﬁcant predictor of upward mobility in a mul-
tivariable regression but income segregation does not.
These results are consistent with the view that the negative
effects of segregation may operate by making it more difﬁcult to
reach jobs or other resources that facilitate upward mobility. But
any such spatial mismatch explanation must explain why the
gradients emerge before children enter the labor market, as
shown in Section V.E. A lack of access to nearby jobs cannot di-
rectly explain why children from low-income families are also
more likely to have teenage births and less likely to attend college
in cities with low levels of upward mobility. However, spatial
mismatch could produce such patterns if it changes children’s
behavior because they have fewer successful role models or redu-
ces their perceived returns to education.
VI.C.
Income Levels and Inequality
In this subsection, we explore the correlation between prop-
erties of the local income distribution—mean income levels and
inequality—and intergenerational mobility.
1. Mean Income Levels. The third section of Figure VIII shows
that the mean level of household income in a CZ (as measured in
the 2000 census) is essentially uncorrelated with upward mobility
(see Online Appendix Figure XI Panel A for the corresponding
nonparametric binned scatter plot). Children in low-income

families who grow up in the highest-income CZs (with mean in-
comes of $47,600 a year) reach almost exactly the same percentile
of the national income distribution on average as those who grow
up in the lowest-income areas (with mean incomes of $21,900).
2. Income Inequality. Prior work has documented a negative
correlation between income inequality and intergenerational mo-
bility across countries (Corak 2013). This ‘‘Great Gatsby’’ curve
(Krueger 2012) has attracted attention because it suggests that
greater inequality within a generation could reduce social mobil-
ity. We explore whether there is an analogous relationship across
areas within the United States by correlating upward mobility
with the Gini coefﬁcient of parent income within each CZ. We
compute the Gini coefﬁcient for parents in our core sample
within each CZ as Gini ¼ 2
X c CovðXic; PicÞ, where X c is the mean
family income (from 1996 to 2000) of parents in CZ c and
Cov(Xic, Pic) is the covariance between the income level (Xic) and
the percentile rank (Pic) of parents in CZ c. The correlation be-
tween the Gini coefﬁcient and upward mobility is 0.578 (see also
Online Appendix Figure XI Panel B).
An alternative measure of inequality is the portion of income
within a CZ that accrues to the richest households, for example,
those in the top 1%. This measure is of particular interest because
the rise in inequality in the United States over the past three
decades was driven primarily by an increase in top income
shares (Piketty and Saez 2003). We calculate top 1 percent
income shares using the distribution of parent family income
within each CZ. The correlation between upward mobility and
the top 1 percent income share is only 0.190 (see also Online
Appendix Figure XI Panel C), much weaker than that with the
Gini coefﬁcient.
We investigate why the Gini coefﬁcient and top 1% share pro-
duce different results in Table V, which is constructed in the same
way as Table IV. Column (1) replicates the regression correspond-
ing to the raw correlation between the Gini coefﬁcient and upward
mobility as a reference. We decompose the Gini coefﬁcient into
inequality coming from the upper tail and the rest of the income
distribution by deﬁning the bottom 99% Gini as the Gini coefﬁcient
minus the top 1% income share. The bottom 99% Gini can be in-
terpreted as the deviation of the Lorenz curve from perfect equal-
ity among households in the bottom 99%. Column (2) of Table V

shows that a 1 standard deviation increase in the bottom 99% Gini
is associated with a 0.634 standard deviation reduction in upward
mobility. In contrast, a 1 standard deviation increase in the top 1%
share is associated with only a 0.123 standard deviation reduction
in upward mobility. Column (3) shows that in urban areas (CZs
that overlap with MSAs), the pattern is even more stark: upper tail
inequality is uncorrelated with upward mobility, whereas the Gini
coefﬁcient within the bottom 99% remains very highly strongly
correlated with upward mobility.
Another measure of inequality within the bottom 99% is the
size of the middle class in the CZ, which we deﬁne as the fraction
of parents in the CZ who have family incomes between the 25th

Notes. Each column reports regression coefﬁcients from an OLS regression with all variables normal-
ized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the estimation sample, so univariate regression coefﬁ-
cients are equal to correlation coefﬁcients. Columns (1)–(5) are estimated using data for the 709 CZs with at
least 250 children in the core sample. The dependent variable in columns (1)–(4) is our baseline CZ-level
measure of absolute upward mobility, the expected rank of children whose parents are at the 25th national
percentile in the core sample. In column (5), the dependent variable is relative mobility, the rank-rank slope
within each CZ. In column (3), we restrict to CZs that intersect MSAs. In columns (1)–(5), the Gini coefﬁcient is
deﬁned as the Gini coefﬁcient of family income for parents in the core sample in each CZ; the top 1% income
share is deﬁned as the fraction of total parent family income in each CZ accruing to the richest 1% of parents in
that CZ; the Gini bottom 99% is deﬁned as the Gini coefﬁcient minus the top 1% income share; and the fraction
between p25 and p75 is the fraction of parents in each CZ whose family income is between the 25th and 75th
percentile of the national distribution of parent family income for those in the core sample. In columns (6)–(8),
the dependent variable is the log-log IGE estimate by country from Corak (2013, Figure 1). The Gini coefﬁ-
cients across countries are obtained from the OECD Income Distribution Database (series ‘‘Income
Distribution and Poverty: by country’’). We interpret these coefﬁcients as applying to the bottom 99% because
the surveys on which they are based are typically top-coded. The top 1% income share across countries is from
the World Top Income Database (series ‘‘Top 1% Income Share’’). The independent variables are measured in
1985 in columns (6) and (7) and in 2005 in column (8).

and 75th percentiles of the national parent income distribution.
Column (4) of Table V shows that upward mobility is strongly
positively correlated with the size of the middle class.
Finally, column (5) of Table V replicates column (2) using
relative mobility c as the dependent variable. The bottom 99%
Gini coefﬁcient is strongly positively associated with this mea-
sure. That is, greater inequality in the bottom 99% is negatively
related to relative mobility. 47 But once again, the top 1% share is
uncorrelated with relative mobility.
3. Comparison to Cross-Country Evidence. Next, we explore
whether the size of the middle class is more strongly correlated
with intergenerational mobility than upper tail inequality in the
cross-country data as well. In column (6) of Table V, we replicate
Corak’s (2013, Figure 1) result that there is a strong positive
correlation between the Gini coefﬁcient (as measured in survey
data on income in 1985) and the IGE using data from 13 devel-
oped countries compiled by Corak (2013).48 In column (7), we in-
clude the top 1% income share in each country, based on statistics
from the World Top Incomes Database. As in the within–United
States analysis, there is little correlation between the top 1%
income share and intergenerational mobility across countries.
Column (8) shows that results are similar if one uses inequality
measures from 2005 instead of 1985.
We conclude that there is a robust negative correlation
between inequality within the current generation of adults and
mobility across generations. However, intergenerational mobility
is primarily correlated with inequality among the bottom 99%
and not the extreme upper tail inequality of the form that has
increased dramatically in recent decades. Interestingly, this pat-
tern parallels the results we obtained for segregation above: seg-
regation
of
afﬂuence
is
not
signiﬁcantly
correlated
with
intergenerational mobility, whereas segregation of poverty is
negatively associated with mobility.
47. Because parent and child ranks are measured in the national income dis-
tribution, there is nomechanical relationship betweenthe level ofinequalitywithin
the CZs income distribution and the rank-rank slope.
48. We obtain estimates of the Gini coefﬁcient by country from the OECD
Income Distribution Database. We interpret these estimates as applying to the
bottom 99% because surveys typically do not capture the thickness of the top tail
due to top-coding.

VI.D.
School Quality
In the fourth panel of Figure VIII, we study the correlation
between mobility and various proxies for school quality. We ﬁrst
consider two proxies for inputs into school quality: mean public
school expenditures per student and mean class sizes based on
data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
for the 1996–1997 school year. We ﬁnd a positive correlation be-
tween public school expenditures and upward mobility, but the
correlation is not as strong or robust as with measures of inequal-
ity or segregation. There is a strong negative correlation between
class size and upward mobility (columns (1) and (2) of Online
Appendix Table VIII) when pooling all CZs. However, there is
no correlation between upward mobility and class size in more
urban areas (columns (3) and (4)).
One shortcoming of input-based measures of school quality is
that they may capture relatively little of the variation in school
quality (Hanushek 2003). To address this problem, we construct
output-based proxies for school quality based on test scores and
dropout rates adjusted for differences in parent income. We
obtain data on mean grade 3–8 math and English test scores by
CZ from the Global Report Card. The Global Report Card con-
verts school district–level scores on statewide tests to a single
national scale by benchmarking statewide test scores to scores
on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
tests. We obtain data on high school dropout rates from the
NCES for the 2000–2001 school year, restricting the sample to
CZs in which at least 75 percent of school districts have nonmiss-
ing data. We regress test scores on mean parent family income
(from 1996 to 2000) in the core sample and compute residuals to
obtain an income-adjusted measure of test score gains. We con-
struct an income-adjusted measure of dropout rates analogously.
The income-adjusted test score and dropout rates are very
highly correlated with upward mobility across all speciﬁcations,
as shown in the fourth panel of Figure VIII. In the baseline spe-
ciﬁcation, the magnitude of the correlation between both mea-
sures and upward mobility is nearly 0.6. These results are
consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of schools—as
judged by outputs rather than inputs—plays a role in upward
mobility. At a minimum, they strengthen the view that much of
the difference in intergenerational income mobility across areas
emerges while children are relatively young.

VI.E.
Social Capital
Several studies have emphasized the importance of social
capital—the strength of social networks and engagement in com-
munity organizations in local areas—for social and economic out-
comes (Coleman 1988; Borjas 1992; Putnam 1995). We explore
the relationship between mobility and measures of social capital
used in prior work in the ﬁfth panel of Figure VIII.
Our primary proxy for social capital is the social capital index
constructed by Rupasingha and Goetz (2008), which we aggregate to
the CZ level using population-weighted means. This index is com-
prised of voter turnout rates, the fraction of people who return their
census forms, and various measures of participation in community
organizations. The correlation between upward mobility and social
capital is 0.641 in our baseline speciﬁcation, an estimate that is quite
robust across alternative speciﬁcations. Interestingly, one of the orig-
inal measures proposed by Putnam (1995)—the number of bowling
alleys in an area—has an unweighted correlation of 0.562 with our
measures of absolute upward mobility.
We also consider two other proxies for social capital: the frac-
tion of religious individuals (based on data from the Association of
Religion Data Archives) and the rate of violent crime (using data
from the Uniform Crime Report). Religiosity is very strongly pos-
itively correlated with upward mobility, while crime rates are
negatively correlated with mobility.
VI.F.
Family Structure
Many have argued that family stability plays a key role in
children’s outcomes (see Becker 1991; Murray 1984, 2012). To
evaluate this hypothesis, we use three measures of family struc-
ture in the CZ based on data from the 2000 census: (i) the fraction
of children living in single-parent households, (ii) the fraction of
adults who are divorced, and (iii) the fraction of adults who are
married. All three of these measures are very highly correlated
with upward mobility, as shown in the sixth panel of Figure VIII.
The fraction of children living in single-parent households is
the single strongest correlate of upward income mobility among
all the variables we explored, with a raw unweighted correlation
of 0.76 (see Online Appendix Figure XII Panel A for the corre-
sponding nonparametric binned scatter plot). One natural expla-
nation for this spatial correlation is an individual-level effect:
children raised by a single parent may have worse outcomes

than those raised by two parents (Thomas and Sawhill 2002;
Lamb 2004). To test whether this individual-level effect drives
the spatial correlation, we calculate upward mobility in each CZ
based only on the subsample of children whose own parents are
married. The correlation between upward mobility and the frac-
tion of single parents in their CZ remains at 0.66 even in this
subgroup (Online Appendix Figure XII Panel B). Hence, family
structure correlates with upward mobility not just at the individ-
ual level but also at the community level, perhaps because the
stability of the social environment affects children’s outcomes
more broadly. The association between mobility and family struc-
ture at the community level echoes our ﬁndings in Section VI.A
on the community-level effects of racial shares.
VI.G.
Comparison of Alternative Explanations
In Table VI, we assess which of the ﬁve factors identiﬁed
above—segregation, inequality, school quality, social capital,
and family structure—are the strongest predictors of upward mo-
bility in multivariable regressions that control for race and other
covariates. Based on the analysis, we ﬁrst identify the proxy that
has the strongest and most robust univariate correlation with
upward mobility in each category: the fraction of working indi-
viduals who commute less than 15 minutes to work (segregation),
the bottom 99% Gini coefﬁcient (inequality), high school dropout
rates adjusted for income differences (school quality), the social
capital index, and the fraction of children with single parents
(family structure).49 As in preceding regression speciﬁcations,
we normalize all the dependent and independent variables to
have a standard deviation of 1 in the estimation sample for
each regression in Table VI.50
We begin in column (1) with an unweighted OLS regression
of absolute upward mobility r25;c on the ﬁve factors, pooling all
CZs. All of the factors except the Gini coefﬁcient are signiﬁcant
predictors of the variation in absolute upward mobility in this
49. We obtain similar results if we combine the various proxies into a single
index for each factor using weights from an OLS regression of absolute upward
mobility on the proxies within each category.
50. We code the high school dropout rate as 0 for 126 CZs in which dropout rate
data are missing for more than 25% of the districts in the CZ and include an indi-
cator for having a missing high school dropout rate. We do the same for 16 CZs that
have missing data on social capital. We normalize these variables to have mean 0
and standard deviation 1 among the CZs with nonmissing data.

speciﬁcation. Together, the ﬁve factors explain 76 percent of the
variance in upward mobility across areas. Column (2) shows that
the coefﬁcients remain similar when state ﬁxed effects are in-
cluded. Column (3) shows that the estimates are roughly similar
when restricting the sample to urban areas (CZs that intersect
MSAs). Across all the speciﬁcations, the strongest and most
robust predictor is the fraction of children with single parents.
In column (4), we use relative mobility c as the dependent
variable instead of absolute upward mobility. The fraction of

Notes. Each column reports coefﬁcients from an OLS regression with standard errors clustered at the
state level reported in parentheses. The regressions are run using data for the 709 CZs with at least 250
children in the core sample. The dependent variable in columns (1)–(3) and (6)–(8) is our baseline measure
of absolute upward mobility, the expected rank of children whose parents are at the 25th national per-
centile. The dependent variable in columns (4) and (5) is relative mobility, the rank-rank slope within each
CZ. All independent and dependent variables are normalized (in the relevant estimation sample) to have
mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Column (1) reports unweighted estimates across all CZs. Column (2)
includes state ﬁxed effects. In column (3), we restrict to CZs that intersect MSAs. Columns (4)–(8) rep-
licate the unweighted speciﬁcation in column (1) with different dependent and independent variables. The
fraction with short commutes is the share of workers that commute to work in less than 15 minutes
calculated using data for the 2000 census. Gini bottom 99% is the Gini coefﬁcient minus the top 1%
income share within each CZ, computed using the distribution of parent family income within each CZ
for parents in the core sample. Income-residualized high school dropout rate is the residual from a re-
gression of the fraction of children who drop out of high school in the CZ, estimated using data from the
NCES Common Core of Data for the 2000–2001 school year, on mean household income in 2000. Social
capital index is the standardized index of social capital constructed by Rupasingha and Goetz (2008).
Fraction single mothers is the fraction of children being raised by single mothers in each CZ. Fraction
black is the number of people in the CZ who are black alone divided by the CZ population. We code the
high school dropout rate as 0 for 116 CZs in which dropout rate data are missing for more than 25% of the
districts in the CZ, and include an indicator for having a missing high school dropout rate. We do the
same for 16 CZs with missing data on social capital. See Section VI, Online Data Table IX, and Online
Appendix G for additional details on the deﬁnitions of each of these variables.

single parents and commute times are strong predictors of differ-
ences in relative mobility across areas, but the other factors are
not statistically signiﬁcant. To understand why this is the case, in
column (5) we replicate column (4) but exclude the fraction of
children with single parents. In this speciﬁcation, all four of the
remaining factors—including the Gini coefﬁcient—are strong
predictors of the variation in relative mobility across CZs.
Column (6) replicates the speciﬁcation in column (5) using abso-
lute upward mobility as the dependent variable. Once again, all
four factors are strong predictors of upward mobility when the
fraction of single parents is excluded. These results suggest that
the fraction of single parents may capture some of the variation in
the other factors, most notably the level of income inequality.
In the last two columns of Table VI, we explore the role of
racial
demographics
versus
the
other
explanatory
factors.
Column (7) shows that when we regress absolute upward mobility
on both the fraction of single-parent families in the CZ and the
share of black residents, black shares are no longer signiﬁcantly
correlated with upward mobility. Column (8) shows that the cor-
relation of upward mobility with black shares is slightly positive
and statistically signiﬁcant when we include controls for all ﬁve
explanatory factors. These results support the view that the
strong correlation of upward mobility with race operates through
channels beyond the direct effect of race on mobility.
Overall, the results in Table VI indicate that the differences
in upward mobility across areas are better explained by a combi-
nation of the factors identiﬁed above rather than any single
factor. However, the regression coefﬁcients should be interpreted
with caution for two reasons. First, the regression may place
greater weight on factors that are measured with less error
rather than those that are truly the strongest determinants
of mobility. Second, all of the independent
variables are
endogenously determined. These limitations make it difﬁcult to
identify which of the factors is the most important determinant of
upward mobility.
VII. Conclusion
This article has used population data to present a new por-
trait of intergenerational income mobility in the United States.
Intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas.

For example, the probability that a child reaches the top
quintile of the national income distribution starting from a
family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in
San Jose. The spatial variation in intergenerational mobility is
strongly correlated with ﬁve factors: residential segregation,
income inequality, school quality, social capital, and family
structure.
In this article, we have presented a cross-sectional snapshot
of intergenerational mobility for a single set of birth cohorts. In a
companion paper (Chetty et al. 2014), we study trends in mobility
over time. We ﬁnd that the level of intergenerational mobility
(national rank-rank slope) has remained stable for the 1971–
1993 birth cohorts in the United States, especially in comparison
to the degree of variation across areas. A natural question given
the results of the two papers is whether the cross-sectional cor-
relations documented here are consistent with the time trends in
mobility. To answer this question, we predict the trend in the
rank-rank slope implied by changes in the ﬁve key correlates
over time (see Online Appendix I and Appendix Figure XIII).
The predicted changes are quite small because the factors move
in opposing directions. For example, the increase in inequality
and single parenthood rates in recent decades predict a small
decline in mobility in recent decades. In contrast, the decline in
racial segregation and high school dropout rates predict an in-
crease in mobility of similar magnitude. Overall, the cross-sec-
tional correlations documented here are consistent with the lack
of a substantial time trend in mobility in recent decades.
The main lesson of our analysis is that intergenerational mo-
bility is a local problem, one that could potentially be tackled
using place-based policies (Kline and Moretti 2014). Going for-
ward, a key question is why some areas of the United States gen-
erate higher rates of mobility than others. We hope that future
research will be able to shed light on this question by using the
mobility statistics constructed here (available online at the
county by birth cohort level at www.equality-of-opportunity.org)
to study the effects of local policy changes.
