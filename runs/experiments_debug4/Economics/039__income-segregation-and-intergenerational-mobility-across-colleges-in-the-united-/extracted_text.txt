We construct publicly available statistics on parents’ incomes and students’
earnings outcomes for each college in the United States using deidentiﬁed data
from tax records. These statistics reveal that the degree of parental income seg-
regation across colleges is very high, similar to that across neighborhoods. Differ-
ences in postcollege earnings between children from low- and high-income families
are much smaller among students who attend the same college than across col-
leges. Colleges with the best earnings outcomes predominantly enroll students
from high-income families, although a few mid-tier public colleges have both low
parent income levels and high student earnings. Linking these income data to
SAT and ACT scores, we simulate how changes in the allocation of students to
colleges affect segregation and intergenerational mobility. Equalizing application,

admission, and matriculation rates across parental income groups conditional on
test scores would reduce segregation substantially, primarily by increasing the
representation of middle-class students at more selective colleges. However, it
would have little effect on the fraction of low-income students at elite private
colleges because there are relatively few students from low-income families with
sufﬁciently high SAT/ACT scores. Differences in parental income distributions
across colleges could be eliminated by giving low- and middle-income students a
sliding-scale preference in the application and admissions process similar to that
implicitly given to legacy students at elite private colleges. Assuming that 80%
of observational differences in students’ earnings conditional on test scores, race,
and parental income are due to colleges’ causal effects—a strong assumption, but
one consistent with prior work—such changes could reduce intergenerational in-
come persistence among college students by about 25%. We conclude that changing
how students are allocated to colleges could substantially reduce segregation and
increase intergenerational mobility, even without changing colleges’ educational
programs. JEL Codes: I2, J62.
I. INTRODUCTION
How does the higher education system shape intergenera-
tional income mobility in the United States? Many view college as
a pathway to upward income mobility, but if children from higher-
income families attend better colleges on average, the higher ed-
ucation system as a whole may not promote mobility and could
even amplify the persistence of income across generations.
In this article, we analyze how changes in the colleges
that students attend could affect segregation across colleges by
parental income and rates of intergenerational mobility in the
United States.1 To do so, we ﬁrst estimate three sets of param-
eters: (i) parental income distributions by college, (ii) students’
earnings outcomes conditional on parent income by college, and
(iii) the portion of the variation in students’ earnings outcomes
that is attributable to colleges’ causal effects. We construct pub-
licly available statistics on the ﬁrst two elements using data
on all college students in the United States from 1999 to 2013.
We combine these statistics with data on SAT and ACT scores
and estimates of colleges’ causal effects consistent with the prior
1. An alternative approach to amplifying the effects of the higher education
system on intergenerational mobility is to increase colleges’ value-added for low-
income students through changes in their educational programs. Our goal here
is to assess how far one may get through feasible changes in the allocation of
students to colleges, holding their value-added ﬁxed.

literature to simulate how changes in the allocation of students to
colleges affect income segregation and intergenerational mobility.
We use a deidentiﬁed data set constructed by linking data
from federal income tax returns, the Department of Education,
the College Board, and ACT to obtain information on the colleges
that students attend, their earnings in their early thirties, their
parents’ household incomes, and their SAT/ACT scores.2 In the
baseline analysis, we focus on children born between 1980 and
1982—the oldest children whom we can reliably link to parents—
and assign children to colleges based on the college they attend
most frequently between the ages of 19 and 22.
We divide our analysis into three parts. First, we estimate
parental income distributions by college to characterize the degree
of income segregation across colleges. Among “Ivy-Plus” colleges
(the eight Ivy League colleges plus Duke, MIT, Stanford, and the
University of Chicago), more students come from families in the
top 1% (annual family income above $532,000 in 2015 dollars) of
the income distribution (14.5%) than the bottom half of the income
distribution (13.5%). Only 3.8% of students come from the bottom
quintile of the income distribution (families with annual incomes
below $25,000 in 2015 dollars) at Ivy-Plus colleges. As a result,
children from families in the top 1% are 77 times more likely
to attend an Ivy-Plus college compared with the children from
families in the bottom quintile. By contrast, 14.6% of students
at community colleges are from families in the bottom quintile,
and only 0.5% are from the top 1%. We ﬁnd substantial segrega-
tion by parental income not just across selectivity tiers but also
across colleges within the same tier: two-thirds of the variation in
bottom-quintile shares is within college quality tiers.
The degree of income segregation across colleges is as large
as the degree of segregation across the neighborhoods in which
children grow up. For example, among children with parents in
the bottom quintile, 11.8% of their college peers come from the
top quintile, whereas 11.5% of their peers in the ZIP code where
they lived before college come from the top quintile. At the other
end of the spectrum, students from high-income families at Ivy-
Plus colleges have fewer low-income peers in college than in their
childhood neighborhoods. Colleges remain highly segregated even
2. We measure children’s earnings between the ages of 32 and 34; we show
that children’s percentile ranks in the earnings distribution stabilize by age 32 at
all types of colleges.

when we adjust for geographic differences in the distribution of
parent income shares, as in Hoxby and Turner (2019). These ﬁnd-
ings suggest that efforts to increase interaction across socioeco-
nomic groups may be just as valuable at the college level as they
are at the neighborhood level (and may actually be somewhat eas-
ier to implement because there is an admissions process for many
colleges, unlike neighborhoods).
In the second part of the article, we examine the earnings out-
comes of students who attend each college, conditional on parental
income. In the nation as a whole, children from the highest-income
families end up 29 percentiles higher in the earnings distribution
on average than those from the lowest-income families. Control-
ling for college ﬁxed effects, the gap between students from the
highest- and lowest-income families falls to 11 percentiles, 38%
of the national gradient. Hence, much of the gap in outcomes
between children from low- versus high-income families can be
explained by differences between rather than within colleges, rais-
ing the possibility that reallocating students across colleges could
increase intergenerational mobility substantially.
Children from high-income families tend to segregate into
colleges at which students from all parent income levels have
high average earnings outcomes: the (enrollment-weighted) cross-
college correlation between mean parent income rank and mean
student earnings rank of bottom-quintile students is 0.70. How-
ever, some colleges buck this pattern and have a large share of
students from low-income families and relatively good earnings
outcomes, resulting in a high “mobility rate” of students from
the bottom to the top of the income distribution. Examples of
such high-mobility-rate colleges include mid-tier public institu-
tions such as the City University of New York (CUNY), certain
campuses of the California State University system, and several
campuses in the University of Texas system.
The colleges that have the highest mobility rates must either
be particularly good at enrolling low-income students with high
earnings potential or at adding substantial value for students
from low-income families. In either case, they are an interesting
set of institutions to study in future work for those interested in
reducing income segregation or increasing mobility more broadly.
These colleges do not differ substantially from other colleges on
institutional characteristics like public-versus-private status, in-
structional expenditures, or endowments. This similarity in ob-
servable characteristics between high and low mobility colleges

turns out not to hold if we focus on upper-tail mobility—the frac-
tion of students who come from bottom-quintile families and reach
the top 1% of the earnings distribution (earnings > $182,000 at
ages 32–34). The highest upper-tail mobility rates are concen-
trated at highly selective private colleges with large endowments,
such as Ivy-Plus colleges.
In the third part of the article, we simulate how income
segregation across colleges and intergenerational mobility would
change if students were allocated to colleges differently. We be-
gin by evaluating the extent to which differences in parental
income distributions across colleges can be explained by differ-
ences in academic preparation before students apply to college,
as proxied for by SAT or ACT scores.3 We ﬁnd that at any given
level of SAT/ACT scores, children from higher-income families
attend more selective colleges, suggesting that low- and middle-
income students “undermatch” to colleges (Bowen, Chingos, and
McPherson 2009). To quantify the degree of undermatching, we
construct an “income-neutral” student allocation process, in which
we ﬁll each college’s slot for a current student who has test score s
with a random draw from the population of college students with
test score s who come from the same state and are of the same
race. In this scenario, colleges continue to enroll students based on
both academic and nonacademic credentials but eliminate vari-
ation in enrollment rates by parental income—whether due to
differences in application, admissions, or matriculation—among
students with comparable academic credentials, preserving the
racial and geographic composition and the total size of each col-
lege. This counterfactual thus provides a natural benchmark to
gauge the extent to which student bodies are representative of the
underlying population of academically qualiﬁed students.4
3. We follow a large body of prior work in using standardized test scores
as a widely available measure of end-of-high-school academic preparation (e.g.,
James et al. 1989; Dale and Krueger 2002) that is highly predictive of long-term
outcomes such as earnings. We conﬁrm and extend these results by showing that
SAT scores are strong predictors of later earnings even conditional on parental
income, race, and the high school or college a child attends in Online Appendix L.
Of course, other measures may also be helpful in assessing academic preparation
and qualiﬁcations. Our analysis does not speak to the relative merits of test scores
versus other proxies to assess precollege qualiﬁcations.
4. This counterfactual exercise differs from the approach of simply admitting
students with the highest test scores considered by Bastedo and Jaquette (2011)
and Carnevale et al. (2019). Because colleges place signiﬁcant weight on factors

Income segregation across colleges would fall signiﬁcantly if
students enrolled at colleges in an income-neutral manner con-
ditional on their test scores. The degree of underrepresentation
of students from the bottom parental income quintile at selective
(Barron’s Tier 6 or higher) colleges would fall by 38% relative
to a benchmark in which all colleges have the same fraction of
bottom-quintile students as in the current population of college-
goers. This is because top-quintile students are currently 34%
more likely to attend selective colleges than their bottom-quintile
peers with the same test scores. The income-neutral allocation
would also increase the representation of middle-income stu-
dents (the second, third, and fourth quintiles) at selective colleges
substantially.
The picture is somewhat different at the most selective elite
private (Ivy-Plus) colleges. There, the fraction of students from
the middle class (the second, third, and fourth quintiles) would
rise substantially, from 28% to 38%, under income-neutral allo-
cations. But there would be little absolute change (from 3.8% to
4.4%) in the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile,
reducing underrepresentation relative to the benchmark in which
all colleges have the same fraction of bottom-quintile students
by only 9%. These ﬁndings show that it is in fact middle-income
students who attend Ivy-Plus colleges at the lowest rates, condi-
tional on test scores—what many have referred to as the “missing
middle” at elite private colleges.5 Our results imply much less un-
dermatching of high-achieving low-income students at such col-
leges than found by Hoxby and Avery (2013) because there are
few children from low-income families who have sufﬁciently high
SAT/ACT scores. For instance, only 3.7% of children who score
above a 1300 on the SAT come from families in the bottom in-
come quintile.6 High-scoring students from low-income families
are scarce in substantial part because of disparities in schools,
unrelated to test scores in practice, we believe this counterfactual provides a more
plausible benchmark for understanding the extent to which differences in test
scores can explain income segregation across colleges.
5. The phrase “missing middle” has been used to describe the relative under-
representation of middle-class students at elite private institutions since at least
Todd (1976). More recently, Hoxby and Turner document results consistent with
these ﬁndings, as reported in Rampell (2019).
6. We ﬁnd many fewer high-achieving students from low-income families than
that estimated by Hoxby and Avery (2013). This difference arises because we
measure parental income at the individual level rather than using geographic

neighborhoods, and other environmental factors that accumulate
from birth (Heckman and Krueger 2005; Fryer and Levitt 2013;
Chetty and Hendren 2018; Reardon 2019). These precollege dis-
parities limit the scope to increase the number of students from
the lowest-income families at elite colleges purely by recruiting
more applications.
Further increasing the fraction of low-income students at
selective colleges would require policies that induce low-income
students to attend highly selective colleges at higher rates than
higher-income students with currently comparable SAT scores. If
low-income (bottom quintile) students attended colleges compara-
ble to high-income (top quintile) students with 160-point higher
SAT scores, the higher education system would be fully deseg-
regated, in the sense that parental income distributions would
be very similar across all colleges.7 To benchmark the magnitude
of this change, a 160-point SAT increment would be equivalent
to increasing Ivy-Plus attendance rates from 7.3% to 25.8% for
low-income students with an SAT score of 1400. This increment
is very similar in magnitude to the implicit preference in admis-
sions given to various preferred groups, such as legacy students,
recruited athletes, and underrepresented minorities, at elite col-
leges, who are admitted at substantially higher rates than other
students with similar qualiﬁcations (Espenshade, Chung, and
Walling 2004; Arcidiacono, Kinsler, and Ransom 2019).8
How would such changes in segregation affect intergenera-
tional mobility? To answer this question, we need an estimate of
the fraction of the earnings premium at each college (conditional
on parental income, race, and SAT/ACT scores) that is due to the
imputations and because of differences in the thresholds used to deﬁne quantiles
of the income distribution; see Section V.A for details.
7. Phasing out this increment roughly linearly from 160 SAT points in the
bottom quintile down to 0 for the students in the top quintile leads to equal
representation of students from all parental income levels across colleges. Note
that we use the SAT here simply as a convenient metric to quantify the degree of
need-afﬁrmative preference needed to desegregate colleges; in practice, one could
implement such policies using a variety of other metrics and approaches.
8. Our results do not speak to the debate about whether standardized tests pro-
vide comparable measures of aptitude for students from low- versus high-income
families. We simply use test scores to quantify the gap between students from
low- versus high-income families in end-of-high-school academic qualiﬁcations.
Whether that gap can be closed through changes in K–12 education, test design
or preparation, or the college application or admissions process is a question left
for future work.

causal effect of attending that college. Naturally, our simulated
effects on intergenerational mobility are highly sensitive to this
parameter: if differences in earnings across colleges are driven
purely by selection rather than causal effects, reallocating stu-
dents across colleges would have no impact on mobility. To gauge
what fraction of the difference in earnings across colleges is at-
tributable to causal effects, we regress students’ earnings on our
estimates of mean earnings premia (conditional on race, parental
income, and test scores), controlling for other observable charac-
teristics such as gender, high-school GPA, and high-school ﬁxed
effects. We then follow Dale and Krueger (2002) and also control
for the set of colleges to which a student applied to capture selec-
tion on unobservables. Including such controls yields a coefﬁcient
between 0.8 and 1, suggesting that at least 80% of the difference in
earnings premia across colleges (conditional on parental income,
race, and test scores) reﬂects causal effects. We therefore assume
that 80% of the earnings premium at each college is driven by a
causal effect in our baseline analysis. We also assume that student
reallocations do not change colleges’ causal effects, even though
the composition of the student body might change substantially.
We measure intergenerational mobility as the difference in
the chance that college students from low- versus high-income
families reach the top earnings quintile, a simple measure of rel-
ative mobility (Chetty et al. 2014). Empirically, this difference is
22 percentage points for children in the 1980–82 birth cohorts.
The income-neutral benchmark would narrow the gap by 15%,
and need-afﬁrmative admissions would narrow the gap by 27%.
These are substantial effects given that children’s outcomes in
adulthood are shaped by a cumulation of environmental factors
from birth until the point they enter the labor market (Chetty and
Hendren 2018), and most people spend at most 25% of their pre-
labor-market years in college. The precise magnitudes that result
from these simulations must of course be interpreted with cau-
tion because they hinge on strong assumptions, namely, about the
causal effect of colleges. Nevertheless, they suggest that chang-
ing which colleges students attend—that is, reducing segregation
without making any efforts to increase colleges’ value-added or
reduce disparities that emerge before students apply to college—
could increase economic mobility substantially.
The three parts of our analysis reconcile conﬂicting ﬁndings
in prior work. First, several papers have studied income segrega-
tion in higher education by selectivity tier or at selected colleges

(e.g., Avery et al. 2006; Goodman 2008; Deming and Dynarski
2010; Hoxby and Turner 2013; Marx and Turner 2015; Andrews,
Imberman, and Lovenheim 2016; Manoli and Turner 2018). These
studies ﬁnd a wide range of estimates using small samples; for in-
stance, the estimated fraction of students from bottom-quartile
families at elite colleges ranges from 3% (Carnevale and Strohl
2010) to 11% (Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin 2006, chapter 7) across
studies. Our new statistics provide more deﬁnitive estimates of
the degree of segregation across college tiers, shed light on seg-
regation across colleges within selectivity tiers, and offer the ﬁrst
statistics on top-income shares by college.
Second, a smaller literature has measured the returns to at-
tending certain colleges using quasi-experimental methods (e.g.,
Black and Smith 2004; Hoekstra 2009; Hastings, Neilson, and
Zimmerman 2013; Zimmerman 2014; Kirkeboen, Leuven and
Mogstad 2016; Cellini and Turner 2019). Our analysis comple-
ments these studies by providing information on earnings dis-
tributions for all colleges. These data allow us to characterize
how students’ earnings distributions vary with parental income
in each college and identify “outlier” colleges in terms of students’
outcomes whose admissions policies or educational practices could
be studied in future quasi-experimental work.
Finally, our counterfactual analysis follows prior work ex-
amining how alternative admissions rules would affect the com-
position of colleges by selectivity tier (e.g., Arcidiacono 2005;
Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin 2006; Epple, Romano, and Sieg 2006;
Krueger, Rothstein, and Turner 2006; Howell 2010). This work
has again reached conﬂicting conclusions on the degree of under-
matching and the consequences of alternative admissions regimes
(Carnevale and Rose 2004, Hill and Winston 2006, Carnevale
and Strohl 2010, Bastedo and Jaquette 2011, Hoxby and Avery
2013). In addition to reconciling these ﬁndings, we contribute
to this literature by (i) analyzing counterfactuals across all col-
leges rather than by college tier, which proves to be quantita-
tively important; and (ii) showing impacts not just on the com-
position of the student body but on rates of intergenerational
mobility.
The article is organized as follows. Section II describes
the data. Section III presents results on parent income seg-
regation. Section IV examines students’ earnings outcomes.
Section V presents results on the relationship between SAT/ACT
scores and parent income (undermatching) and discusses the

II. DATA
In this section, we describe how we construct our analysis
sample, deﬁne the key variables used in the analysis, and present
summary statistics.
II.A. Sample Deﬁnition
Our primary sample of children consists of all individuals
in the United States who (i) have a valid Social Security Num-
ber (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number (ITIN),
(ii) were born between 1980 and 1991, and (iii) can be linked
to parents with nonnegative income in the tax data (see Online
Appendix A for more details).9 There are approximately 48.1 mil-
lion people in this sample.
We identify a child’s parents as the most recent tax ﬁlers to
claim the child as a child dependent during the period when the
child is 12–17 years old. If the child is claimed by a single ﬁler,
the child is deﬁned as having a single parent. We assign each
child a parent (or parents) permanently using this algorithm, re-
gardless of any changes in parents’ marital status or dependent
claiming. Children who are never claimed as dependents on a
tax return cannot be linked to their parents and are excluded
from our analysis. However, almost all parents ﬁle a tax return at
some point when their child is between age 12–17, either because
their incomes lie above the ﬁling threshold or because they are
eligible for a tax refund (Cilke 1998). Thus, the number of chil-
dren for whom we identify parents exceeds 98% of children born
in the United States between 1980 and 1991 (Online Appendix
Table I).10
9. Because we limit the sample to children who can be linked to parents
in the United States (based on dependent claiming on tax returns), our sample
excludes college students from foreign countries. We limit the sample to parents
with nonnegative income (averaged over ﬁve years as described in Section II.C)
because parents with negative income typically have large business losses, which
are a proxy for having signiﬁcant wealth despite the negative reported income.
The nonnegative income restriction excludes 0.95% of children.
10. The fraction of children linked to parents drops sharply prior to the 1980
birth cohort because our data begin in 1996 and many children begin to leave the

II.B. College Attendance
1. Data Sources.
We obtain information on college at-
tendance from two administrative data sources: federal tax
records and Department of Education records spanning 1999–
2013.11 We identify students attending each college in the
administrative records primarily using Form 1098-T, an informa-
tion return ﬁled by colleges on behalf of each student to report
tuition payments. All institutions qualifying for federal ﬁnancial
aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 must ﬁle
a 1098-T in each calendar year for any student who pays tuition.
Because the 1098-T data do not always cover students who pay no
tuition—who are typically low-income students receiving ﬁnan-
cial aid—we supplement the 1098-T data with Pell grant records
from the Department of Education’s National Student Loan Data
System (NSLDS; U.S. Department of Education 2013a). See
Online Appendix B for details on these two data sources and how
we assign students to colleges.
Because neither data source relies on voluntary reporting or
tax ﬁling, our data provide a near-complete roster of college atten-
dance at all Title IV accredited institutions of higher education in
the United States. Aggregate college enrollment counts in our data
are well aligned with aggregate enrollments from the Current
Population Survey (U.S. Census Bureau 2011) and college-speciﬁc
enrollment counts from IPEDS (U.S. Department of Education
2013b; Online Appendix Table I, Online Appendix B).12
2. Deﬁnition of College Attendance.
Our goal is to construct
statistics for the set of degree-seeking undergraduate students at
each college. Because we cannot directly separate degree seekers
from other students (summer school students, extension school
students, etc.) in our data, we proceed in two steps in our base-
line deﬁnition of college attendance. First, we deﬁne a student as
household starting at age 17 (Chetty et al. 2014). Hence, the 1980 birth cohort is
the earliest cohort we analyze.
11. Information on college attendance is not available in tax records prior
to 1999, and the latest complete information on attendance available from the
Department of Education at the point of this analysis was for 2013.
12. Students at some multicampus systems cannot be assigned to a speciﬁc
campus and therefore are aggregated into a single cluster. There are 85 such
clusters, comprising 17.5% of students and 3.9% of colleges in our data. Separately,
1.8% of student-year observations are assigned to a “colleges with incomplete or
insufﬁcient data” category because of incomplete 1098-T data.

attending a given college in a given calendar year if she appears

the college she attends for the most years over the four calendar
years in which she turns 19, 20, 21, and 22. If a student attends
two or more colleges for the same number of years (which occurs
for 9% of children), we deﬁne the student’s college as the ﬁrst col-
lege she attended.13 Because we do not observe degree completion,
students who do not graduate are included in all of the statistics
we report.
To evaluate the robustness of our results, we also consider
two alternative attendance measures: age 20 college (the college a
student attends in the calendar year that she turns 20) and ﬁrst-
attended college (the college a student attends ﬁrst between the
calendar years in which she turns 19 and 28).
II.C. Incomes
We obtain data on children’s and parents’ incomes from fed-
eral income tax records spanning 1996 to 2014. We use data from
both income tax returns (1040 forms) and third-party informa-
tion returns (e.g., W-2 forms), which contain information on the
earnings of those who do not ﬁle tax returns. We measure income
in 2015 dollars, adjusting for inﬂation using the consumer price
index (CPI-U).
1. Parent Income.
We measure parent income as total pre-
tax income at the household level. In years where a parent ﬁles
a tax return, we deﬁne family income as adjusted gross income
(as reported on the 1040 tax return). This income measure in-
cludes labor earnings and capital income. In years where a parent
does not ﬁle a tax return, we deﬁne family income as the sum of
wage earnings (reported on form W-2) and unemployment bene-
ﬁts (reported on form 1099-G). In years where parents have no tax
return and no information returns, family income is coded as 0.
Importantly, the income distribution in the tax data is very similar
to that in the American Community Survey (ACS) when one uses
the same income deﬁnitions (Online Appendix C, Online Appendix
Table II).
We average parents’ family income over the ﬁve years when
the child is aged 15–19 to smooth transitory ﬂuctuations (Solon
13. If the student attended multiple “most attended” colleges in the ﬁrst year,
which occurs for 1.6% of students, then a college is chosen at random from that
set.

1992) and obtain a measure of resources available at the time
when most college attendance decisions are made.14 We then as-
sign parents income percentiles by ranking them based on this
mean income measure relative to all other parents who have chil-
dren in the same birth cohort.
2. Child Income.
Our primary measure of children’s income
in adulthood is total pretax individual earnings. For single ﬁlers,
individual earnings is deﬁned as the sum of wage earnings and
net self-employment income if positive (i.e., net of one-half of the
self-employment tax) as reported on Form 1040. For joint ﬁlers, it
is deﬁned as the sum of the individual’s wage earnings reported
on his own W-2 forms, the individual’s net self-employment in-
come (if positive) reported on Form SE, and half of the additional
wage earnings reported on Form 1040 relative to the sum of the
spouses’ W-2 wage earnings (see Online Appendix A for details).
For nonﬁlers, individual earnings is deﬁned as the sum of wage
earnings reported on the individual’s W-2 forms.
We measure children’s incomes in 2014—the most recent year
in which we observe earnings—to minimize the degree of life cycle
bias that arises from measuring children’s earnings at too early an
age. We assign children income percentiles by ranking them based
on their individual earnings relative to other children in the same
birth cohort. We show in Online Appendix D that the earnings
ranks of children in our analysis sample stabilize by 2014.
We also consider two alternative measures of child income in
sensitivity analyses: household income, deﬁned in the same way
as parents’ household income, and household earnings, the sum
of individual earnings (deﬁned as above) for the child and his or
her spouse. Household income includes capital income, whereas
household earnings does not.
14. Following Chetty et al. (2014), we deﬁne mean family income as the
mother’s family income plus the father’s family income in each year from 1996
to 2000 divided by 10 (or divided by 5 if we only identify a single parent). For
parents who do not change marital status, this is simply mean family income over
the ﬁve-year period. For parents who are married initially and then divorce, this
measure tracks the mean family incomes of the two divorced parents over time.
For parents who are single initially and then get married, this measure tracks
individual income prior to marriage and total family income (including the new
spouse’s income) after marriage. We exclude years in which a parent does not ﬁle
when computing mean parent income prior to 1999 because information returns
are available starting only in 1999.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
II.D. Precollege Neighborhoods
To measure segregation across neighborhoods, we assign the
students in our sample a childhood neighborhood (ZIP code) as
follows. We ﬁrst identify the primary tax ﬁler on the 1040 that
claimed the child when assigning the child to parents. We then
assign each child to the ZIP code on the primary ﬁler’s 1040 in the
year when the child was 17 or, if the primary ﬁler did not ﬁle a tax
return that year, to the most common ZIP code across the primary
ﬁler’s information returns (e.g., W-2 forms) that year. If no ZIP
code was found in the year when the child was age 17, we search
for the primary ﬁler’s ZIP code when the child was age 16, then 18,
then 15, then 19, then 14, then 20 until a ZIP code is found. Over
99.9% of children are assigned ZIP codes using this algorithm; the
remaining children are grouped into a separate ZIP code.
II.E. Test Scores and Race
We obtained records from the College Board and ACT on stan-
dardized college entrance exam scores and race/ethnicity for chil-
dren in our analysis sample. Our data cover high school graduat-
ing cohorts 1996–2004 for SAT and 1995–2007 for ACT.
We focus on individuals’ SAT composite score (ranging from
400 to 1600), deﬁned as the mathematics score plus the critical
reading score, and the composite ACT score (ranging from 1 to
36). We map ACT scores into equivalent SAT scores using existing
concordance tables, we prioritize the SAT if it is available, and we
use an individual’s maximum composite score if she has taken
multiple of the same tests (see Online Appendix E for details). We
use ﬁve race/ethnicity categories (referred to hereafter as race):
black, Asian, non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and other.
SAT/ACT coverage rates (and therefore race coverage rates)
are very high at selective colleges where standardized tests are
typically required for admission; for instance, we observe a score
for 98.5% of Ivy-Plus attendees. We use SAT/ACT scores and
race primarily in our counterfactual analysis in Section V.15
There we describe and validate a procedure to impute SAT/ACT
scores and race for the 26.2% of students for whom we do not
observe a test score and race.
15. Because of conﬁdentiality restrictions governing the test score data, we
are unable to disclose statistics that make use of test score data and/or race data
by college and thus cannot report estimates of earnings conditional on test scores,
race, or other related measures in this study.

II.F. College-Level Statistics
We construct publicly available college-level statistics on chil-
dren’s and parents’ income distributions using data for children
in the 1980–82 birth cohorts.16 These children’s incomes can be
measured at age 32 or older in 2014, the age at which children’s
income ranks stabilize at all colleges (Online Appendix D).
To construct college-level statistics, we ﬁrst exclude colleges
that have fewer than 100 students on average across the 1980–
91 birth cohorts (in years where we have data for that college),
all college-cohort observations with fewer than 50 students, and
college-cohort observations that have incomplete data for two or
more of the four years when students are aged 19–22. These col-
leges are added to a separate “colleges with incomplete or insufﬁ-
cient data” group. We then construct enrollment-weighted means
by college of each statistic for the 1980–82 cohorts, imputing val-
ues from the 1983–84 cohorts for any missing college-by-cohort
observations in the 1980–82 sample (see Online Appendix B for
details). There are 2,199 colleges for which we release statistics, of
which 397 use data exclusively from the 1983–84 cohorts. We re-
port blurred statistics for each college rather than exact values fol-
lowing established disclosure standards (see Online Appendix F);
the blurred estimates are generally very accurate and using the
exact values yields virtually identical results.
For certain analyses, we report statistics for groups of colleges
rather than individual colleges.17 We classify colleges as four-year
or two-year based on the highest degree they offer using IPEDS
data.18 Following prior work (e.g., Deming et al. 2015), we use
data from the Barron’s 2009 index (Barron’s Educational Series,
College Division 2008) to classify four-year colleges into ﬁve tiers
16. We focus on the 1980–82 birth cohorts in this article, but also provide
longitudinal statistics by college for the 1980–91 birth cohorts in our Online Data
Tables. Our statistics expand on those released in the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion’s College Scorecard (2015) by including all students (not just those receiving
federal student aid) and fully characterizing the joint distribution of parent and
child income.
17. Because these groups aggregate data over multiple colleges, the statistics
we report for groups of colleges are exact values rather than estimates and in-
clude college-cohort cells with fewer than 50 students. The college-level statistics
we report do not aggregate exactly to the group-level statistics because of these
differences.
18. Because many colleges offer both two-year and four-year programs, many
students attending a four-year college may be enrolled in a two-year program.

based on their selectivity: Ivy-Plus (the Ivy League plus Stanford,
MIT, Chicago, and Duke), other elite (Barron’s Tier 1 excluding
the Ivy-Plus; 65 colleges for the 1980–91 birth cohorts), highly
selective (Barron’s Tier 2; 99 colleges), selective (Barron’s Tiers
3–5; 1,003 colleges), and nonselective (Barron’s Tier 9 and all
four-year colleges not included in the Barron’s selectivity index;
287 colleges). Finally, we obtain information on college charac-
teristics, such as public versus private versus for-proﬁt status,
instructional expenditures, endowments, and the distribution of
majors from the 2000 IPEDS. We also use information on net cost
of attendance and admissions rate from Department of Educa-
tion’s College Scorecard, as measured in 2013 (U.S. Department
of Education 2015). Online Appendix G provides sources and deﬁ-
nitions for all of the variables we use from the IPEDS and College
Scorecard data.
II.G. Summary Statistics
Table I reports summary statistics for children in our analysis
sample. Overall, 62% of the 10.8 million children in the 1980–82
birth cohorts attend college at some point between the ages of
19 and 22. Another 12% attend college at some point by age 28;
and 27% of children do not attend college at all before age 28.
The median parental household income of children born between
1980 and 1982 is $59,100. The 20th percentile of the parent in-
come distribution is $24,600, and the 80th percentile is $111,100.
The children in these cohorts have median individual earnings of
$26,900 in 2014 (at ages 32–34). The 20th percentile of the child
earnings distribution is $900 and the 80th percentile is $55,800.
Approximately 18.5% of children have $0 in individual earnings
in 2014. See Online Appendix Table III and Table II below for
additional summary statistics.
III. PARENTAL INCOME SEGREGATION ACROSS COLLEGES
In this section, we construct statistics on parents’ income at
each college. This is the ﬁrst of the three key factors that matter
for the role of colleges in intergenerational mobility. Simply put,
if a given college has very few children from low-income families,
it cannot be helping move children up the income ladder. Under-
standing the extent of income segregation across the spectrum of
colleges is therefore a key ﬁrst step in assessing how the higher

Notes. The table presents summary statistics for the analysis sample deﬁned in Section II.F. Column (1)
includes all children in the 1980–82 birth cohorts. Column (2) limits this sample to students who attend a
college (between the ages of 19 and 22) that is included in the public data release, using imputed data from
the 1983–84 birth cohorts for colleges with insufﬁcient data in the 1980–82 birth cohorts (see Section II,
Online Appendix B, and Section II.F for details). This is the sample used for most of our analyses. Column
(3) includes children in the 1980–82 birth cohorts who did not attend college between the ages of 19 and 22.
Children are assigned to colleges using the college that they attended for the most years between ages 19 and
22, breaking ties by choosing the college the child attends ﬁrst. Ivy-Plus colleges are deﬁned as the eight Ivy
League colleges as well as the University of Chicago, Stanford University, MIT, and Duke University. Elite
colleges are deﬁned as those in categories 1 or 2 in Barron’s Proﬁles of American Colleges (2009). Four-year
colleges are deﬁned using the highest degree offered by the institution as recorded in IPEDS (2013). Parent
income is deﬁned as mean pretax adjusted gross income during the ﬁve-year period when the child was aged
15–19. Parent income percentiles are constructed by ranking parents relative to other parents with children
in the same birth cohort. Children’s earnings are measured as the sum of individual wage earnings and
self-employment income in 2014. At each age, children are assigned percentile ranks based on their rank
relative to children born in the same birth cohort. Children are deﬁned as employed if they have positive
earnings. In column (2), the number of children is computed as the average number of children in the cohorts
available for a given college multiplied by 3. Medians are not reported in column (2) because the imputations
are implemented at the college rather than individual level. We report dollar values corresponding to other
key quantiles in column (1) because those are the thresholds used to deﬁne the income groups we use in our
analysis (bottom 20%, top 20%, etc.). All monetary values are measured in 2015 dollars. Statistics in column
(1) are constructed based on online data Tables 6 and 9; in column (2) based on online data Table 2; and
in column (3) based on online data Table 6, with the exception of median income and earnings, which are
constructed directly from the individual-level microdata.

Notes. This table presents statistics on parental income segregation and children’s earnings outcomes by college tier; see Section II.F and Online Appendix G for deﬁnitions of these
tiers. All statistics reported are for children in the 1980–82 birth cohorts. All distributional statistics are enrollment-weighted means of the exact values for each college, except for
median parent income and child earnings, which are the mean incomes for the percentile of the overall income or earnings distribution which contains the within-tier median. For
example, the median Ivy-Plus parent falls in the 92nd percentile of the overall income distribution, and the mean income for Ivy-Plus parents in the 92nd percentile of the overall
distribution is $171,000. The exact fraction of students from less than two-year colleges with parents in the top 1% is not available due to small sample sizes in the publicly available
data. The trend statistics are coefﬁcients from enrollment-weighted univariate regressions of the share of parents from the bottom 20% or 60% on student cohort, multiplied by 11;
the statistics can therefore be interpreted as the trend change in lower-parent-income shares over the 1980–91 cohorts. Rank-rank slopes are coefﬁcients from a regression of child
income rank on parent income rank with college ﬁxed effects, as in Table III; Panels E–G; see notes to that table for further details. Top-quintile outcome rates are the fractions
of children who reach the top 20% or 1% conditional on having parents in the bottom quintile. Mobility rates are the fractions of children who have parents in the bottom income
quintile and whose own earnings place them in either the top 20% or top 1% of their own age-speciﬁc income distribution. Parents’ incomes are measured at the household level when
children are between the ages of 15 and 19, while children’s incomes are measured at the individual level in 2014. See notes to Table I for further details on income deﬁnitions and
how children are assigned to colleges. Statistics in columns (1)–(4), (7)–(10), and (12) are constructed based on online data Table 6; in column (5) based on online data Table 7; in
column (11) based on online data Table 3; and in column (6) directly from the individual-level microdata.

INCOME SEGREGATION AND INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY

education system affects intergenerational mobility. Moreover, the
degree of income segregation is of interest in its own right given
growing concerns about the political and social consequences of
segregation.
III.A. Baseline Statistics
We begin by analyzing parental income distributions across
colleges using our analysis sample (the 1980–82 birth cohorts).
As a reference, Figure I, Panel A plots college attendance
rates by parent income percentile. Similar to statistics reported
in Chetty et al. (2014) and Hilger (2016)—but now adding Pell
grant recipients that were missing in the 1098-T data used in
those studies—college attendance rates range from 32% in the
bottom parent income percentile to 95% in the top parent income
percentile. This ﬁgure shows that the extensive margin of whether
students attend college varies greatly with parental income. Here,
we analyze the extent to which the types of colleges children attend
also vary with parental income.
Figure I, Panel B plots the parental income distribution
at four colleges that are representative of the broader vari-
ation across colleges: Harvard University, the University of
California-Berkeley (UC-Berkeley), the State University of New
York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, and Glendale Community College
in Los Angeles County. The bars show the fraction of parents in
each quintile of the parental income distribution (ranking parents
relative to other parents with children in the same birth cohort).
The share of families coming from the top 1% is shown by the
cross-hatched bars within the top quintile. Of children at Harvard
in the 1980–82 birth cohorts, 3.0% come from the lowest income
quintile of families (household income below $25,000), compared
with more than 70% from the top quintile (income > $111,000).19
Of students at Harvard, 15.4% come from families in the top 1%
of the income distribution (income > $532,000), about the same
number as from the bottom three quintiles combined.
This highly skewed parental income distribution is represen-
tative of other elite private colleges. Figure I, Panel C shows
the distribution of parent income at the 12 Ivy-Plus colleges.
Each of the 100 dots represents the fraction of students at those
colleges with parents in a speciﬁc income percentile. There are
more students who come from families in the top 1% (14.5%)
19. These percentile cutoffs are computed using the household income distri-
bution for parents of children in the 1980 birth cohort when their children were
between the ages of 15 and 19.

Parental Income and College Attendance
Panel A plots the fraction of students in our analysis sample (1980–82 birth
cohorts) who attend college at any time during the years in which they turn 19–
22 by parental income percentile. Panel B plots the percentage of students with
parents in each quintile of the income distribution at Harvard University, Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley, State University of New York at Stony Brook,
and Glendale Community College in the analysis sample. The percentage of stu-

Panel C plots the percentage of students in the analysis sample with parents in
each income percentile pooling all 12 Ivy-Plus colleges, which include the 8 Ivy-
League colleges as well as the University of Chicago, Stanford University, MIT,
and Duke University. Parent income is deﬁned as mean pretax adjusted gross in-
come (in 2015 dollars) during the ﬁve-year period when the child was aged 15–19.
Parent income percentiles are constructed by ranking parents relative to other
parents with children in the same birth cohort. Children are assigned to colleges
using the college that they attended for the most years between ages 19 and 22,
breaking ties by choosing the college the child attends ﬁrst. Panel A is constructed

than the bottom half of the parent income distribution (13.5%).
Only 3.8% of students at these colleges come from families in

than are children from the bottom quintile. This degree of income
concentration at elite colleges is substantially greater than that
implied by their internal data (Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin 2006,
chapter 7).
Returning to Figure I, Panel B, now consider UC-Berkeley. A
smaller share of students at Berkeley, one of the most selective
public colleges in the United States, are from high-income families
than are at Harvard. As parental income falls, the likelihood that
a child attends Berkeley rather than Harvard rises monotonically.
This ﬁnding is representative of a more general fact: students from
the lowest-income families are less likely to attend the nation’s
most selective private colleges than they are to attend its most
selective public colleges. Since students from the lowest-income
families pay very little tuition to attend elite private colleges, this
result suggests that tuition costs are not the primary explanation
for the underrepresentation of low- and middle-income students
at elite private colleges.
Even at Berkeley, more than 50% of students come from the
top quintile, compared with only 8.8% from the bottom quintile.
The other colleges in Figure I, Panel B have many more students
from low-income families. SUNY-Stony Brook, a public second-tier
(between rank 78 and 176) institution according to the Barron’s
rankings, has a much more even distribution of parental incomes
although there are still signiﬁcantly more students from the top
quintile (30.1%) than the bottom quintile (16.4%). Glendale Com-
munity College has a monotonically declining fraction of students
across the income quintiles, with 32.4% of students coming from
the bottom quintile and only 13.6% from the top quintile.
These four examples are more broadly illustrative of the large
differences in parental income distributions across colleges with
different levels of selectivity. We present statistics on the parental
income distribution (and other key statistics analyzed in the fol-
lowing sections) by college tier in Table II.20 We classify colleges
into 12 tiers based on their selectivity (as deﬁned by Barron’s 2009
Index; see Section II.F for details), public versus private status,
and whether they offer two-year versus four-year degrees. The
fraction of students from families in the bottom quintile rises as
one moves down selectivity tiers, ranging from 3.8% at Ivy-Plus
colleges to 7.1% at “selective private” colleges to 21% at for-proﬁt
20. For simplicity, we report tier-speciﬁc statistics using the set of colleges for
which we have data in the 1980–82 birth cohorts in Table II, without including
data imputed from later cohorts.

colleges. Conversely, the fraction of students coming from the top
1% falls from 14.5% to 2.4% and 0.4% across these tiers.
Our estimates of the degree of income segregation across
selectivity tiers are broadly aligned with estimates using De-
partment of Education survey data (Carnevale and Strohl 2010;
Bastedo and Jaquette 2011). However, our college-level data re-
veal considerable segregation by parental income even across col-
leges within these tiers. After regressing bottom-quintile parental
income shares on tier ﬁxed effects, we ﬁnd that 66.8% of the vari-
ation in bottom-quintile shares lies within tiers. For example,
within the selective public tier, the fraction of students from the
bottom quintile ranges from 3.7% at the 10th percentile to 15.3%
at the 90th percentile of colleges (enrollment-weighted). Hence,
studies that analyze differences across tiers signiﬁcantly under-
state the degree of income segregation in the higher education
system.
The analysis focuses exclusively on students who attend col-
lege before age 22. Children from low-income families tend to
attend college at later ages than do children from higher-income
families (Online Appendix Figure I). To evaluate whether these
differences in age of attendance affect our estimates, we recon-
struct all of the statistics deﬁning college attendance based on
the ﬁrst college a child attends up through age 28. As an ad-
ditional robustness check, we construct estimates based on the
college that students attend at age 20. We ﬁnd very similar es-
timates of parental income distributions using these alternative
deﬁnitions of college attendance, with correlations of 0.99 of the
bottom-quintile share across colleges using the three measures
(Online Appendix Table IV). More generally, none of the results
reported below are sensitive to how we assign students to colleges.
III.B. Comparison to Precollege Neighborhood Segregation
There is much interest and discussion about ways to foster
greater interaction across class lines (e.g., Putnam 2016). Most
efforts focus on reducing residential segregation across neighbor-
hoods. We explore how the degree of segregation across colleges
compares to the degree of segregation across neighborhoods. The
goal of this analysis is to provide information that may be useful in
targeting policies: if colleges are as segregated as neighborhoods,
it might be valuable to devote as much attention to reducing seg-
regation in the higher education system as across neighborhoods.

INCOME SEGREGATION AND INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY

We focus on answering the following simple question: when
students get to college, do they ﬁnd themselves with a more di-
verse peer group in terms of parental income than in the neigh-
borhood in which they grew up? We measure segregation using
exposure indices, asking what fraction of a child’s peers in their
childhood neighborhood or college come from parent quintile q,
conditional on their own parents’ income quintile. The degree of
residential segregation depends on the geographic unit one uses:
larger geographic units will generally yield smaller estimates of
segregation. To discipline our comparisons, we look for a tractable
geographic unit whose size (in terms of number of people) is sim-
ilar to the size of colleges. ZIP codes are a convenient unit that
satisfy this property: the average number of children in a ZIP code
is 1,860, compared with an average of 2,351 students per college.21
We therefore deﬁne an individual’s childhood neighborhood as the
ZIP code in which she or he was claimed as a dependent before
attending college (see Section II.D for details). When measuring
segregation across colleges, we treat those who do not attend any
college as if they all attended a single distinct college.
Figure II shows that the degree of segregation across col-
leges is very similar to the degree of segregation across childhood
neighborhoods. First consider children with parents in the bottom
quintile of the income distribution. If there were no segregation,
20% of their peers would have parents in each quintile of the in-
come distribution. Instead, Figure II, Panel A shows that 29.7%
of their childhood peers and 26.8% of their college peers also come
from families in the bottom quintile. Segregation is greater for
children who come from the top of the income distribution. Among
children with parents in the top quintile, 34.5% of childhood peers
and 33.3% of college peers also have top-quintile parents. Among
children with parents in the top 1%, 47.2% of childhood peers and
45.9% of college peers have top 20% parents (Online Appendix
Table V).
We reach similar conclusions when examining segregation
within speciﬁc subsets of colleges. For example, Figure II, Panel C
replicates Panel B for the subset of students who attend Ivy-Plus
colleges (similar statistics are reported separately for each college
in our online data tables). We saw already that most students
21. If anything, ZIP codes are smaller than colleges, suggesting that colleges
are more segregated than geographic units of comparable size, bolstering our point
that the higher education system ampliﬁes socioeconomic stratiﬁcation beyond
that experienced in childhood neighborhoods of comparable size.

Income Segregation across Colleges versus Precollege Neighborhoods
This ﬁgure plots parental income segregation measures across the neighbor-

sample includes all children in our analysis sample (1980–82 birth cohorts), pool-
ing non-college-goers into a single group. Panel A plots the income distribution
of neighborhood and college peers for children with parents in the bottom income
quintile. Panel B replicates Panel A for children with parents in the top income
quintile. Panel C replicates Panel B for children who attended Ivy-Plus colleges.

at Ivy-Plus colleges come from very afﬂuent families; Figure II,
Panel C shows two additional results about the backgrounds of
students at these colleges.
First, comparing Figure II, Panel C with Panel B, we see that
children who attend Ivy-Plus colleges tend to grow up in areas
with a larger fraction of high-income peers than does the aver-
age child, controlling for their own parents’ incomes. For example,
among children with parents in the top quintile, 34.5% of child-
hood peers come from the top quintile on average, compared with
48.5% for those who went on to attend Ivy-Plus colleges. This

1591
pattern is consistent with Chetty et al. (2018) ﬁnding that chil-
dren growing up in more afﬂuent neighborhoods tend to have
better outcomes on average.22
Second, Figure II, Panel C shows that even though children
from high-income families who attend Ivy-Plus colleges grow up
in especially segregated neighborhoods, they are even less ex-
posed to low-income peers in college. For example, among those
with parents in the top quintile, 68.7% of their college peers are
from the top quintile as well—higher than the 48.5% rate in their
childhood neighborhoods.
Naturally, when we examine children from low-income fam-
ilies who attend elite colleges, we see the opposite pattern: these
children are much more exposed to higher income peers in college
than in their childhood neighborhoods, because Ivy-Plus colleges
predominantly have students from high-income families (Online
Appendix Table VI). This pattern holds more generally when we
focus on all college students. Excluding those who do not attend
college, for children with parents in the bottom quintile, 13.7%
of their childhood peers are from the top quintile, compared with
22.5% of their college peers (Online Appendix Table VII). This is
again because college attendance rates rise sharply with parental
income, as shown in Figure I, Panel A. Since most college goers
are from higher-income families, low-income children who go to
college must be more exposed to higher-income peers in college
than in their childhood neighborhoods.
In short, college leads to greater exposure to higher-income
peers for the relatively few children from low-income families who
attend college, especially elite colleges. For children from high-
income families, we see less exposure to low-income peers in col-
lege than in childhood. Overall, pooling all children—including
those who do not attend college—we ﬁnd that on average,
children are exposed to the same types of peer groups at age 20
as they are in their childhood neighborhoods.
The similarity between our measures of segregation across
colleges and residential segregation could partly be due to the
fact that many colleges draw from a local pool of students, as most
22. Another possibility is that household-level incomes are mismeasured, giv-
ing neighborhood-level measures of income more predictive power. Our baseline
estimates average parental incomes over a ﬁve-year period to capture permanent
incomes; we ﬁnd that using even longer time averages generally does not affect
the results appreciably.

students stay at or near their childhood home when attending col-
lege. Put differently, parental income distributions across colleges
could differ simply because of differences in local income distribu-
tions rather than differences in admissions or application policies.
To assess the importance of this issue, we follow Hoxby and Turner
(2019) and construct an alternative set of “locally normed” statis-
tics that adjust for differences in the income distribution of the
pool of students applying to each college. We assume that private
elite colleges (i.e., private colleges in the top two selectivity tiers)
draw students from a nationwide pool, the remaining selective
colleges (i.e., private colleges in the top two tiers and all colleges
in the next four tiers) draw students from a state-speciﬁc pool,
and unselective colleges (i.e., tiers 7–12) draw students from their
local commuting zone.23 We construct locally normed measures
by ﬁrst dividing each college’s parent income quintile shares by
the parent income quintile shares of its potential pool of students.
For each college, we divide these ﬁve values by the sum of the ﬁve
values so that the ﬁnal normed shares sum to 1. The resulting
statistics, reported by college in our online data tables, can be in-
terpreted as the parental income distributions that would arise
at each college if every college had the same (national) pool of
potential applicants.
We ﬁnd that raw bottom-quintile shares are highly correlated
with the normed bottom-quintile shares (enrollment-weighted
correlation = 0.77). For example, the normed statistics imply that
14.9% of the college peers of children from families in the bot-
tom quintile come from the bottom quintile themselves (Online
Appendix Table VIIc), very similar to the 15.7% estimate based
on the raw statistics in Online Appendix Table VIIb.24 Hence,
most of the parental income segregation across colleges in the
United States is not driven by differences in the state- or CZ-wide
pools from which they draw. Intuitively, there is much greater in-
come heterogeneity within most CZs than between CZs, implying
that the sharp differences in parental income distributions across
colleges cannot be driven purely by cross-CZ income differences.25
23. Commuting zones (CZs) are aggregations of counties that approximate
local labor markets and collectively span the entire United States.
24. We focus on segregation measures within the subset of college students
here because the normed statistics are ill-deﬁned for students who do not attend
college.
25. Some of the differences across colleges–especially unselective colleges–may
be due to more local income differences within CZs, as students at less selective
colleges tend to come from nearby neighborhoods.

IV. STUDENTS’ EARNINGS OUTCOMES
In this section, we study children’s earnings outcomes (con-
ditional on parental income) at each college, the second of the
three key factors that matter for the role of colleges in intergen-
erational mobility. We begin by examining the intergenerational
persistence of income within colleges and then analyze how stu-
dents’ earnings outcomes and rates of intergenerational mobility
vary across colleges.
IV.A. Heterogeneity in Earnings Outcomes within Colleges
As a reference, the series in circles in Figure III, Panel A
plots the mean individual earnings rank of children conditional
on their parents’ household income rank in our analysis sample,
following Chetty et al. (2014). Children born to richer parents
have higher earnings: on average a 1 percentage point increase in
parent rank is associated with a 0.288 percentage point increase
in children’s mean income ranks between ages 32–34.26 That is,
children from the highest-income families end up 29 percentiles
higher in the income distribution on average relative to children
from the poorest families in the nation.27
In this subsection, we analyze how much of the uncondi-
tional gradient in Figure III, Panel A can be explained (in an
accounting sense) by the colleges that children attend. Answer-
ing this question—along with parent income segregation and
value-added estimates—is useful for understanding the role of
higher education in intergenerational mobility. If the degree of
intergenerational income persistence within colleges were the
same as in the population as a whole, reallocating students
across colleges would not affect mobility. If, on the other hand,
children from low- and high-income families who attend the same
college have similar earnings outcomes, changes in the colleges
26. We show in Online Appendix D and in Online Appendix Figure II that
the distribution of students’ earnings ranks stabilize at all colleges by age 32. Of
course, individuals’ earnings levels continue to rise sharply during their thirties,
but this rank-preserving fanning out of the distribution does not affect our rank-
based analysis.
27. This estimate is smaller than the 34 percentile gap reported in Chetty
et al. (2014) because we use individual earnings rather than household income.
We present estimates using household income below.

Relationship between Children’s and Parents’ Ranks within Colleges
This ﬁgure shows the relationship between children’s income ranks and par-
ents’ income ranks for children in the 1980–82 birth cohorts. The series in circles
in Panel A plots the mean child rank for each parent income percentile, pooling all
children in our analysis sample. The series in triangles in Panel A repeats the se-
ries in circles after including college ﬁxed effects, constructed by demeaning both
child and parent ranks within each college, computing an enrollment-weighted
average across colleges of the resulting series for each college, and adding back
the national means of child and parent rank (50). Children who do not attend
college are grouped into a single category for this purpose. The series in squares
in Panel A repeats the series in triangles and interacts the college dummies with
20-point SAT/ACT bins. The slopes reported are for a linear regression ﬁt on the
plotted points. Panel B plots the mean child rank in each parent income ventile
(5 percentile point bin) versus the mean parent rank in that ventile for students
at the University of California at Berkeley, State University of New York at Stony
Brook, and Glendale Community College. The ﬁgure also plots the mean child rank
versus parent income percentile in the nation as a whole (including non-college-
goers) as a reference. We report rank-rank slopes for each college, estimated using
an OLS regression on the 20 plotted points, weighting by the count of observations
in the microdata in each parent ventile. To construct the series for each college
group plotted in Panel C, we ﬁrst run an enrollment-weighted OLS regression of
children’s ranks on indicators for parents’ income ventile and college ﬁxed effects.
We then plot the coefﬁcients on the parent income ventiles, normalizing the coef-
ﬁcients on the ventile indicators so that the mean rank across the 20 coefﬁcients
matches the mean unconditional mean rank in the relevant group. The rank-rank
slope in each group is obtained from an OLS regression of child rank on parent rank
including college ﬁxed effects in the microdata. Children’s incomes are measured
in 2014 and children are assigned percentiles based on their rank relative to other

notes to Figure I for the deﬁnition of parent income ranks. In Panel C, elite col-
leges are all colleges (including Ivy-Plus colleges) classiﬁed as “most competitive”
(category 1) by Barron’s Proﬁles of American Colleges (Barron’s Educational Series
2009). Other four-year colleges include all other four-year institutions excluding
the elite group, based on highest degree offered by the institution as recorded
in IPEDS (2013). Two-year includes all two-year institutions. This ﬁgure is con-
structed directly from the individual-level microdata.
that students attend could potentially have larger effects on
mobility.28
Empirically, we ﬁnd that the rank-rank relationship is much
ﬂatter within colleges than in the nation as a whole. To illustrate,
Figure III, Panel B shows the rank-rank relationship among stu-
dents at three of the colleges examined above in Figure I, Panel
B: UC-Berkeley, SUNY-Stony Brook, and Glendale Community
College.29 To increase precision, we plot the mean rank of chil-
dren in each college by parent ventile (5 percentage point bins)
rather than percentile. The rank-rank slopes at each of these col-
leges, estimated using OLS regressions on the plotted points, are
less than or equal to 0.06, one-ﬁfth as large as the national slope
of 0.29.
Figure III, Panel C shows that this result holds more gener-
ally across all colleges. It plots the relationship between children’s
ranks and parents’ ranks conditional on which college a child at-
tends for colleges in three tiers: elite four-year (Barron’s Tier 1), all
other four-year, and two-year colleges (see Table II for estimates
for each of the 12 tiers). To construct each series in this ﬁgure,
we restrict the sample to those who attended a given college tier
and then regress children’s ranks on parent ventile indicators
and college ﬁxed effects and plot the coefﬁcients on the 12 ven-
tile indicators. The slopes are estimated using OLS regressions
28. One could in principle skip this observational analysis entirely and directly
estimate the causal effect of attending every college in the United States. Since
estimating such a large vector of causal effects is challenging, it is useful to instead
proceed in two steps by ﬁrst constructing observational estimates of earnings
outcomes by college and then assessing how much of the observational differences
reﬂects causal effects versus selection on average.
29. We omit Harvard from this ﬁgure because the very small fraction of low-
income students at Harvard makes estimates of the conditional rank for children
from low-income families very noisy; the estimated rank-rank slope for Harvard
is 0.112 (std. err. = 0.018). For the same reason, we combine the Ivy-Plus category
with other elite colleges in Figure III, Panel C.

of children’s ranks on their parents’ ranks in the microdata, with
college ﬁxed effects. Among elite colleges, the average rank-rank
slope is 0.065 on average within each college. The average slope
is higher for colleges in lower tiers—0.095 for other four-year col-
leges and 0.11 for two-year colleges—but is still only one-third as
large as the national rank-rank slope.30 The steeper slope could
potentially arise because colleges in lower tiers are less selective
and thus admit a broader spectrum of students in terms of abilities
or because there is substantial heterogeneity in completion rates
at lower-tier colleges, which may correlate with parent income.
Children from low- and high-income families at a given col-
lege have not only relatively similar mean rank outcomes but
also a relatively similar distribution of earnings outcomes across
all percentiles. Online Appendix Figure III replicates Figure III,
Panels B and C, replacing the outcome used to measure children’s
earnings by an indicator for being in the top quintile (earnings
above approximately $56,000 at ages 32–34). Nationally, children
from the highest-income families are about 40 percentage points
more likely to reach the top quintile than children from the poor-
est families. Conditional on college ﬁxed effects, this gap shrinks
to about 20 percentage points.
1. Sensitivity Analysis.
In Table III, we explore the robust-
ness of these results using alternative income deﬁnitions and sub-
samples. Each cell of the table reports an estimate from a separate
regression of children’s outcomes on parents’ ranks, with standard
errors reported in parentheses. The ﬁrst column of the table re-
ports estimates from the baseline speciﬁcation discussed above.
The ﬁrst row replicates the slope reported in Figure III,
Panel A, the unconditional rank-rank slope pooling all children.
The next row adds college ﬁxed effects, including those who did
not attend a college in a separate “no college” category. Includ-
ing college ﬁxed effects reduces the 0.288 unconditional slope by
half to 0.139, as shown in the series in triangles in Figure III,
Panel A.
30. These ﬁndings are consistent with prior research using survey data show-
ing that the association between children’s and parents’ incomes or occupational
status is much weaker among college graduates (Hout 1988; Torche 2011). Our
data show that conditioning on the speciﬁc college a child attends further reduces
the correlation between children’s and parents’ incomes, and that this holds true
even at elite colleges, where concerns about mismatch of low-income students are
most acute.

Notes. This table presents estimates from OLS regressions of children’s ranks on parents’ ranks using data for children in the 1980–82 birth cohorts. Each cell reports the coefﬁcient
on parent rank from a separate regression, with standard errors in parentheses. Panel A uses the full population of children. Panels B and C also use the full population, but use
college and college by 20-point SAT/ACT bin ﬁxed effects. Panel D restricts to all children that attend college (between the ages of 19 and 22) and includes ﬁxed effects for the college
the child attended. Panels E, F, and G replicate the speciﬁcations in Panel D, restricting the sample to children who attended particular types of colleges: elite (Barron’s Tier 1)
colleges, all other four-year colleges, and two-year colleges. In all speciﬁcations, the independent variable is the parents’ household income rank, calculated by ranking parents relative
to other parents with children in the same birth cohort based on their mean pretax adjusted gross income during the ﬁve-year period when the child was aged 15–19. Column 1
uses the child’s individual earnings rank in 2014 as the dependent variable. Column two adjusts both the dependent variable and independent variable for cost of living: we deﬂate
both parents’ and children’s incomes (based on where they live when we measure their incomes) using a CZ-level price index constructed using local house prices and retail prices
as in Chetty et al. (2014, Appendix A). In column (3), the dependent variable is an indicator for whether the child is working (deﬁned as having positive earnings) in 2014. Columns
(4) and (5) replicate column (1), restricting the sample to male and female children, respectively. Column six uses children’s ranks based on their household adjusted gross income
instead of their individual earnings as the dependent variable. Column (7) uses an indicator for whether the child is married as the dependent variable. Column (8) uses children’s
ranks based on their household wage earnings plus self-employment income as the dependent variable. Columns (6)–(8) all use the full sample of children. See notes to Table I for
further details on college assignment and income deﬁnitions. Statistics in this table are constructed directly from the individual-level microdata.

The third row shows that controlling additionally for
SAT/ACT scores (interacted with the college ﬁxed effects) does not
change the relationship between parent and child income within
colleges signiﬁcantly. The series in squares in Figure III, Panel A
shows this result graphically. Hence, the differences in outcomes
between children from low- and high-income families who attend
the same college are not explained by differences in academic
ability or preparation, as proxied for by test scores at the point of
college application.
If we restrict the sample to those who attend college, the rank-
rank slope with college ﬁxed effects falls further to 0.10, as shown
in row 4, because the rank-rank slope is larger for students who
do not attend college. The remaining rows show that we obtain
similar rank-rank slopes within speciﬁc college tiers, with ﬂatter
slopes at more elite colleges as discussed above.
Table III, columns (2)–(8) present variants of the speciﬁca-
tions in column (1) to assess the sensitivity of the preceding con-
clusions to various factors. Column (2) deﬂates both parents’ and
childrens’ incomes by local costs of living. This adjustment makes
little difference because children tend to reside as adults near
where they grew up, so cost-of-living adjustments tend to move
parent and child ranks either both up or both down, thereby pre-
serving their correlation.
In columns (3)–(5), we assess whether the observed intergen-
erational persistence of income might be low, especially within
elite colleges, because children from high-income families at such
colleges choose not to work (e.g., because they marry a high-
earning college classmate). In practice, children from high-income
families are slightly more likely to work, even within elite colleges,
as shown in column (3), which replaces the childrens’ individual
earnings rank outcome with an indicator for whether the child
works. Even for men, for whom the hours of work margin is likely
to be less important, the rank-rank slope is 0.09 within elite col-
leges, much lower than the national slope of 0.33 (column (4)).
These results suggest that differences in labor force participa-
tion rates do not mask latent differences in the earnings poten-
tials of children from low- versus high-income families within elite
colleges.
The degree of intergenerational persistence in income is sub-
stantially larger when measuring income at the household level
(column (6)) than the individual level because children from richer
families are much more likely to be married, even conditional on

college attendance (column (7)). Finally, column (8) shows that
adding capital income to household earnings yields very similar
results.
IV.B. Heterogeneity in Earnings Outcomes across Colleges
The relatively small within-college rank-rank slopes esti-
mated above imply that most of the intergenerational persistence
of income at the national level must be accounted for by differences
in earnings outcomes across the types of colleges that children
from low- versus high-income families attend. Indeed, we ﬁnd that
children from low-income families tend to segregate into colleges
at which students have lower earnings outcomes. The enrollment-
weighted correlation between mean parent income rank and mean
student earnings rank is 0.78 across colleges. Likewise, the corre-
lation between mean parent income rank and the mean student
earnings rank of bottom-quintile students is 0.70.
In light of the importance of between-college heterogeneity in
accounting for the intergenerational persistence of income, in this
subsection we examine how earnings outcomes and mobility rates
vary across colleges in greater detail. We do so by focusing on two
statistics: the fraction of students from low-income families and
the fraction of such students who reach the top quintile (earn-
ings above $58,000 for children in the 1980 cohort). The product
of these two statistics is the college’s upward mobility rate, the
fraction of its students who come from the bottom quintile (Q1) of
the parent income distribution and end up in the top quintile (Q5)
of the child earnings distribution:
P(Child in Q5 and Parent in Q1)
= P(Parent in Q1) × P(Child in Q5 | Parent in Q1)
mobility rate = fraction low-income × top-quintile outcome rate
Importantly, mobility rates reﬂect a combination of selection ef-
fects (the types of students admitted) and causal effects (the
value-added of colleges). In this subsection, we simply document
how mobility rates vary across colleges without distinguishing
between these two factors; we separate these two components in
Section V when analyzing counterfactuals.
Figure IV, Panel A plots the fraction of low-income students
who reach the top quintile (P(Child in Q5|Parent in Q1)) ver-
sus the fraction of its low-income students (P(Parent in Q1)).

FIGURE IV (Continued). college. Children’s ranks are constructed by comparing
their earnings in 2014 to others in the same birth cohort. Parent income percentiles
are constructed by ranking parents relative to other parents with children in the
same birth cohort. Multiplying a college’s top quintile outcome rate by its fraction
of low-income students yields the college’s “mobility rate,” the probability that a
child has parents in the bottom parent income quintile and reaches the top quintile
of the child income distribution. The curves plot isoquants representing the 10th,
50th, and 90th percentiles of the distribution of mobility rates across colleges. Ivy-
Plus and public ﬂagship colleges are highlighted. Ivy-Plus colleges are deﬁned in
the notes to Figure I. Public ﬂagships are deﬁned using the College Board Annual
Survey of Colleges (2016). Public ﬂagships that are part of a super-OPEID cluster
that contains multiple schools are omitted. We report the mean mobility rate for
these two sets of colleges and the standard deviation (SD) of mobility rates across
all colleges. Panel B repeats Panel A using the fraction of students who reach
the top 1% of the earnings distribution on the y-axis (instead of the top 20%).
All estimates use the analysis sample and all statistics reported are weighted by
enrollment. See notes to Figure I for details on the measurement of parent incomes
and college attendance. This ﬁgure is constructed based on online data Tables 2
and 10.
Consistent with the foregoing ﬁndings, colleges with higher frac-
tions of low-income students tend to have fewer students who
reach the top earnings quintile on average. However, because the
correlation between fraction low-income and top quintile outcome
rate is −0.50 (and not −1), there is still considerable heterogeneity
in mobility rates across colleges. To illustrate this heterogeneity,
we plot isoquants representing the set of colleges that have mo-
bility rates at the 10th percentile (0.9%), median (1.6%), and 90th
percentile (3.5%) of the enrollment-weighted distribution across
colleges. This variation is substantial given that the plausible
range for mobility rates in the economy as a whole is from 0%
(perfect immobility) to 4% (perfect mobility, where children’s earn-
ings are independent of their parents’ incomes and 4% of children
transition from the bottom to top quintile).
Which colleges have the highest mobility rates? Table IV,
Panel A lists the colleges with the 10 highest mobility rates among
colleges with 300 or more students each year (excluding approxi-
mately 5% of students in our sample). The college with the highest
mobility rate is California State University–Los Angeles, where
nearly 10% of students come from a family in the bottom quintile
of the income distribution and reach the top quintile. California
State-LA’s high mobility rate combines a top-quintile outcome rate
of 29.9%—close to the 90th percentile across all colleges—with a
low-income student share of 33.1%—above the 95th percentile
across all colleges. SUNY-Stony Brook ranks third at 8.4%, and
the CUNY system ranks sixth, with an average mobility across its

17 campuses of 7.2%.31 Eight out of the 10 are public institutions,
with Pace University and St. John’s University in New York as
the only private not-for-proﬁt colleges.
Table IV, Panel A shows that the colleges with the highest mo-
bility rates tend to be mid-tier public colleges that combine moder-
ate top-quintile outcome rates with a large fraction of low-income
students. In contrast, the 12 Ivy-Plus colleges, highlighted in large
blue circles in Figure IV, Panel A, have a mean top-quintile out-
come rate of 58%, but mean fraction low-income of 3.8%, leading
to a mean mobility rate of 2.2%, slightly above the national me-
dian. Flagship public universities such as UC-Berkeley and the
University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, highlighted in large red trian-
gles in Figure IV, Panel A (color version online), have a somewhat
higher mean fraction low-income (5.2%) but a considerably lower
mean top-quintile outcome rate (33.4%), so that their average
mobility rate is lower than that of the Ivy-Plus group.32 At the
other end of the spectrum, the colleges with the lowest mobility
rates consist primarily of certain nonselective colleges at which a
very small share of students reach the top quintile. For example,
several community colleges in North Carolina have top-quintile
outcome rates below 4% and mobility rates below 0.5%. Notably,
the top-quintile outcome rates at these colleges are below those of
children who do not attend college between the ages of 19 and 22
(4.1%).
There is substantial heterogeneity in mobility rates even
among colleges with similar observable characteristics. Of the
variation in mobility rates, 98.4% is within selectivity tiers. To
take a speciﬁc example, consider the University of California-Los
Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Southern California (USC).
Both colleges are in Los Angeles, were tied for the no. 21 U.S. re-
search university in U.S. News and World Report’s 2018 rankings,
and have 54.6% of their low-income students reach the top earn-
ings quintile. However, UCLA has a 10.2% fraction low-income
compared to USC’s 7.2% and therefore has a 42% higher mobility
rate than USC.
Hoxby and Turner (2019) suggest using locally normed
statistics for lists like that in Table IV when comparing colleges’
31. When broken out separately by campus, 6 of the CUNY campuses are
ranked among the top 10 colleges in terms of mobility rates.
32. As discussed in Section II.B, in some cases (e.g., the University of Illinois)
we cannot separate the ﬂagship campus (Urbana) from other campuses. We exclude
such institutions for these calculations.

Notes. This table lists the top 10 colleges by bottom-to-top-quintile mobility rate (Panel A) and upper-tail
mobility rate (Panel B), among colleges with 300 or more students a year. The bottom-to-top-quintile mobility
rate is the fraction of students whose parents were in the bottom quintile of the parent household income
distribution (when they were aged 15–19) and whose own earnings (at ages 32–34) place them in the top
quintile of the children’s income distribution. The mobility rate equals the product of the fraction of children
at a college with parents in the bottom quintile of the income distribution (fraction low-income) and the
fraction of children with parents in the bottom quintile of the income distribution who reach the top quintile
of the income distribution (top-quintile outcome rate). The upper-tail mobility rate is deﬁned analogously,
measuring the fraction of students who reach the top 1% instead of the top 20%. Parent income ranks, child
income ranks, and college assignment are described in the notes to Table I. The CUNY System includes all
CUNY undergraduate campuses except for the recently founded William E. Macaulay Honors College and
Guttman Community College. Statistics in this table are constructed based on online data Tables 2 and 15,
excluding colleges that have been closed as of September 2019.
mobility rates to adjust for differences in the pool of students they
draw from. We present such normed measures of mobility rates
in our online data tables, adjusting parental income distributions
as described in Section III.B.33 These measures paint a broadly
33. We focus on the raw statistics as our baseline measures both for simplicity
and because whether and how to norm the raw statistics is open to debate. To
help readers construct their own preferred measures, we report estimates of local
income distributions for our analysis sample in our online data tables.

similar picture of differences in mobility rates (though the
estimates change for certain colleges); for instance, 5 of the 10
highest mobility rate colleges in Table IV, Panel A remain in the
top 10 using the normed measures.34 This is because most of the
variation in mobility rates is within local areas: the standard
deviation of mobility rates falls only from 1.3% to 1.0% when
controlling for a college’s CZ (Online Appendix H).35
In sum, although children from low-income families tend
to attend colleges with relatively poor earnings outcomes—
potentially
amplifying
the
intergenerational
persistence
of
income—there are several colleges that buck this pattern and
have high mobility rates. These colleges must either enroll par-
ticularly high-ability students from low-income families or have
especially positive treatment effects on such students. We now
explore whether these colleges have certain systematic charac-
teristics as a ﬁrst step toward understanding their educational
models.
1. Characteristics of High-Mobility-Rate Colleges.
Table IV,
Panel A reports correlations between various college characteris-
tics and the fraction of low-income students, the fraction of those
students who reach the top quintile, and mobility rates. Correla-
tions with fractions of low-income and mobility rates are weighted
by enrollment; correlations with top-quintile outcome rates are
weighted by low-income enrollment.
The ﬁrst 10 rows present univariate correlations with
nondemographic characteristics of colleges, including the college’s
STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) ma-
jor share, an indicator for public control, net costs to low-income
students, and instructional expenditure per student. Each vari-
able is signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with the fraction of low-
income and signiﬁcantly positively correlated with top-quintile
outcome rate, except public control, which carries the opposite
signs. These opposite-signed correlations result in modest and
typically insigniﬁcant correlations with mobility rates. For exam-
ple, the STEM share has a modest positive correlation of 0.12,
34. Eight of the top 10 colleges remain in the top 22 using the normed mea-
sures. South Texas College is located in America’s third-poorest CZ and falls to
rank 318.
35. Online Appendix H also shows that we obtain similar results when using
household income instead of individual income to estimate mobility rates, allaying
concerns that the differences are driven by variation in labor force participation
rates among secondary earners.

showing that high-mobility-rate colleges do not have systemati-
cally different ﬁelds of study (Online Appendix Figure V). Colleges
with higher STEM shares have signiﬁcantly higher earnings out-
comes but also have signiﬁcantly fewer low-income students. As a
result of these offsetting forces, mobility rates end up being only
weakly correlated with the distribution of majors. Similarly, the
public institution indicator has an insigniﬁcant correlation of 0.04
with mobility rate. Although public colleges dominate the top 10
list in Table IV, Panel A, there are many public colleges that have
much lower top-quintile outcome rates and hence much lower mo-
bility rates than private colleges.
We ﬁnd much stronger correlations between mobility rates
and the demographic characteristics of the undergraduate stu-
dent body at each college. The share of Asian undergraduates
has a correlation of 0.53 with mobility rates, as the Asian share
is highly positively correlated with the top-quintile outcome rate
but uncorrelated with the fraction of low-income students. The
shares of Hispanic and black undergraduates are also positively
correlated with mobility rates, with the converse pattern. Using a
simple bounding exercise in Online Appendix I, we show that only
a small fraction of these ecological (group-level) correlations can be
driven by individual-level differences in incomes across racial and
ethnic groups. Hence, non-Asian students at colleges with larger
Asian shares must also have higher top quintile outcome rates.
We also ﬁnd a correlation of 0.26 between mobility rates and
average CZ income, perhaps reﬂecting the fact that children who
go to college in high-income CZs (such as New York) tend to stay
nearby and get higher-paying jobs after college.
IV.C. Upper-Tail Mobility
The measure of mobility analyzed above—moving from the
bottom to top quintile—is one of many potential ways to deﬁne
upward mobility. Alternative measures that deﬁne mobility rates
more broadly—such as moving from the bottom quintile to the top
two quintiles, moving from the bottom 40% to the top 40%, or mov-
ing up two quintiles relative to one’s parents—exhibit very similar
patterns across colleges. All of these measures have enrollment-
weighted correlations with our baseline measures exceeding 0.8
(Online Appendix Table VIII).
There is, however, one measure of mobility that exhibits
very distinct patterns: upper-tail mobility, that is, reaching the

top 1% of the earnings distribution ($182,000 at ages 32–34).
Figure IV, Panel B plots the top-percentile outcome rate—deﬁned
as the fraction of children who reach the top 1% conditional on
starting in a family in the bottom quintile—versus the fraction of
low-income students. The Ivy-Plus colleges, which are highlighted
in large blue circles, have distinctly higher top-percentile outcome
rates than other institutions, with an enrollment-weighted mean
of 12.8%. Unlike with top-quintile outcome rates, there are no
colleges with top-percentile outcome rates comparable to the Ivy-
Plus colleges that have higher fractions of low-income students.
Because their students are so much more likely to reach the
top 1%, many Ivy-Plus colleges rank among the top 10 colleges
in terms of upper-tail mobility rates despite having relatively
few students from low-income families (Table IV, Panel B). In-
terestingly, none of the colleges that appear on the top 10 list in
terms of bottom-to-top quintile mobility in Table IV, Panel A ap-
pear on the top 10 list in terms of upper-tail mobility in Panel
B. Hence, the educational models associated with broadly deﬁned
upward mobility are distinct from those associated with upper-tail
mobility.
Unlike with bottom-to-top quintile mobility, Table V, Panel B
shows that observable characteristics are very strongly correlated
with upper-tail mobility. Colleges that have higher upper-tail mo-
bility rates tend to be smaller, have larger endowments, have
higher completion rates, and have greater STEM shares. The col-
leges with the highest upper-tail mobility rates are all highly se-
lective, high-expenditure, elite colleges. This uniform description
of high upper-tail mobility rate colleges contrasts with the rel-
atively diverse set of educational models associated with higher
top-quintile mobility rate colleges. In this sense, the institutional
model of higher education associated with the selection and/or
production of “superstars” is distinct from and much more homo-
geneous than the variety of institutional models associated with
upward mobility deﬁned more broadly.

Notes. This table presents univariate correlations of college characteristics with mobility statistics, with
standard errors in parentheses. Correlations with fraction low-income (column (1)) and mobility rates (column
(3)) are weighted by enrollment; correlations with top outcome rates (column (2)) are weighted by the number
of students with parents in the bottom income quintile. The correlations are computed using the analysis
sample, excluding observations that are clusters combining multiple college campuses (see Section II.B for
details). Panel A reports correlations with bottom-to-top quintile mobility and top-quintile outcome rates;
Panel B reports correlations with bottom-quintile to top 1% mobility and top-percentile outcome rates. See
notes to Figure IV for deﬁnitions of mobility rates, fraction low income, and top outcome rates. STEM major
share is the percentage of degrees awarded in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ﬁelds in
IPEDS (2000). “Public” is an indicator for whether a school is public based on the control of the institution
reported by IPEDS (2013). Selectivity is based on the Barron’s (2009) Selectivity Index, with ﬁve groups
deﬁned in the text; for this variable, the correlations reported are rank correlations. Graduation rate is
measured as the graduation rate for full-time undergraduates that graduate in 150% of normal time in
IPEDS (2002). Sticker price is the sum of tuition and fees for academic year 2000–2001 from IPEDS. Net cost
for poor is measured as the average net cost of attendance for academic year 2009–2010 from the College
Scorecard (2013). Expenditure per student is deﬁned as the instructional expenditure excluding operations
and maintenance and interest divided by total enrollment in IPEDS (2000). Average faculty salary is the
average faculty salary for full-time faculty in academic year 2001–2002 in IPEDS. Endowment per student is
the ending value of endowment assets in 2000 divided by the number of students in IPEDS (2000). Enrollment
is the sum of total full-time and part-time undergraduate students enrolled in fall 2000. The racial and ethnic
share variables are drawn from IPEDS in 2000 and are deﬁned as the fraction of Asian, black, and Hispanic
undergraduate students at a college. Average CZ income is drawn from the 2012–2016 American Community
Survey’s ﬁve-year estimates. Each correlation is computed using the subset of colleges for which the relevant
covariate is nonmissing. Rates of missing data are below 7% for all variables except for endowments per capita,
which is missing for 49% of the (enrollment-weighted) observations. See Online Appendix G for further details
on the deﬁnitions of the covariates. Statistics in this table are constructed based on online data Table 2.
on SAT and ACT scores as a proxy for students’ academic quali-
ﬁcations at the point of application. We ﬁrst show how SAT/ACT
scores vary with parental income, a relationship that is central
for understanding the results we establish below. We simulate
how alternative allocations of students to colleges would change
the degree of income segregation across colleges and the rate of
intergenerational mobility in the economy.
The reallocations we propose hold constant total national
spending on higher education, since we hold the number of seats
at each college ﬁxed. However, they would require a change in the
allocation of funding across families and colleges, because some
colleges would have larger shares of low-income students and thus
have lower net tuition revenue given the ﬁnancial aid packages
they currently offer. Hence, the counterfactual allocations we sim-
ulate below should not be thought of as policy proposals but as
benchmarks that shed light on the drivers of segregation across
colleges and the potential impacts of changing which students
attend which colleges on economic mobility.

V.A. Undermatching: SAT/ACT Scores by Parent Income
The relationship between test scores on college entrance ex-
ams and parental income is important for understanding the types
of policies that could mitigate segregation in higher education. If a
large fraction of high-achieving (high-scoring) students come from
low- and middle-income families relative to their representation
at highly selective colleges, one could potentially reduce segrega-
tion at elite colleges by recruiting and admitting high-achieving,
low-income applicants at higher rates. In contrast, if low-income
students have much lower SAT/ACT scores than high-income stu-
dents, one may require other approaches, such as need-afﬁrmative
admissions to reduce segregation across colleges.
Several studies in the literature on “undermatching” have
analyzed how SAT/ACT scores vary with parental income, but
they have reached conﬂicting conclusions. Some studies (e.g.,
Carnevale and Strohl 2010; Hoxby and Avery 2013) ﬁnd that there
are many high-achieving, low-income students, but others (e.g.,
Carnevale and Rose 2004; Hill and Winston 2006; Bastedo and
Jaquette 2011) ﬁnd relatively few such students.
Our data permit a more precise analysis of the degree of un-
dermatching than prior work by combining administrative data on
parental income, college attendance, and SAT/ACT scores. How-
ever, like many prior studies, we do not observe test scores for a
signiﬁcant share (26.2%) of college students, presumably because
they were not required to take a standardized entrance exam by
the college they attended. We impute an SAT score to these stu-
dents using the SAT/ACT score of the college student from the
same parent income quintile, state, and college selectivity tier
who has the closest level of earnings in adulthood.36
This imputation methodology relies on the assumption that
the joint distribution of college, parent income quintile, state, and
imputed test scores matches what one would observe if all stu-
dents were to take the SAT or ACT. This assumption would be
violated if the latent scores of non-SAT/ACT-takers differ system-
atically from SAT/ACT-takers. We evaluate the validity of this
assumption using data from ﬁve states where the SAT or ACT
is administered to nearly all students—Louisiana, Connecticut,
36. All students missing a test score are also missing race, because we obtain
race information from the SAT/ACT data. We impute race to these students using
the same procedure as for test scores.

Maine, North Dakota, and Tennessee. We run our imputation al-
gorithm in two ways: as before, but ignoring state in the impu-
tation algorithm, and then separately pretending that we do not
observe SAT or ACT scores for anyone in these ﬁve states. We then
compare the distribution of imputed scores to the distribution of
actual scores. Both unconditionally and within each college tier
by parent income quintile cell, the quantiles of the imputed SAT
distribution match the quantiles of the actual SAT/ACT distri-
bution almost exactly, supporting the validity of the imputation
procedure (Online Appendix Figure IV).37
Figure V, Panel A plots the parental income distribution of
college students in our analysis sample who have an SAT/ACT
test score above 1300 (the 93rd percentile of the SAT/ACT dis-
tribution). Online Appendix Table IX shows the full joint distri-
bution of test scores and parent income ranks among all college
students. We ﬁnd that students from low-income families have
substantially lower test scores on average and that there are very
few high-achieving students from low-income families.38 For ex-
ample, 3.7% of college goers with an SAT/ACT score of at least
1300 come from families in the bottom quintile, while 53.7% come
from the top quintile. If we limit the sample to the 73.8% of col-
lege goers whose test scores are not imputed, we ﬁnd even fewer
high-scoring, low-income students—for example, a 3.1% bottom-
quintile share among those with scores above 1300—because low-
income college goers are less likely to take the SAT or ACT
(Online Appendix Table X). As an additional robustness check, we
replicate this analysis using data from the National Postsec-
ondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which has student-reported
family income data. The NPSAS-based estimate of the bottom-
quintile share of 1300+ scorers is 4.0% (Online Appendix Table
XI).
Our estimates of the fraction of high-achieving students who
come from low-income families are broadly similar to those re-
ported by Carnevale and Rose (2004), Hill and Winston (2006),
37. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that running our imputation procedure purely using
SAT scores (pretending we do not have ACT data) yields very similar results.
38. One should not infer from this result that SAT/ACT scores simply serve
as a proxy for parent income: parental income ranks actually explain only 8.6%
of the variance in SAT/ACT scores in our analysis sample. Though students from
lower-income families have lower SAT/ACT scores on average, many students from
middle- and high-income families do not have high SAT/ACT scores.

and Bastedo and Jaquette (2011), but are substantially smaller
than those estimated in the inﬂuential study of Hoxby and Avery
(2013).39 Hoxby and Avery estimate that 17% of graduating high
school seniors with an SAT score or ACT equivalent of at least
1300 have parents in the bottom quartile of the income distribu-
tion.40 By contrast, our estimate of this statistic is 5.0%. Similarly,
Hoxby and Avery estimate that 39% of students with SAT/ACT
scores above 1300 come from families below the median, compared
with 16.6% in our data.
One reason for this discrepancy may be that Hoxby and Av-
ery impute family income using census tract–level means rather
than using individual-level measures, a natural approach given
that parental income is frequently missing and potentially noisy
in their self-reported data. However, we ﬁnd that higher-income
children within small geographies tend to have higher SAT/ACT
scores using our individual-level data. As a result, using tract-
level means overestimates the number of students from low-
income families who have high test scores. A second reason may
be that Hoxby and Avery deﬁne the 25th percentile of the income
distribution based on family income data from the ACS, but mea-
sure parental incomes based on information drawn from ﬁnancial
39. Carnevale and Rose use the National Educational Longitudinal Study of
1988 to ﬁnd that 3% of those with an SAT score or ACT equivalent above 1300 have
bottom-SES-quartile parents, where SES is the NELS-provided socioeconomic sta-
tus composite of parent income, education, and occupation. Hill and Winston use
population-level SAT and ACT data to ﬁnd that 4.8% of those with at least a
1300 have bottom-quintile parents, based on student-reported incomes and ACS
thresholds. Bastedo and Jaquette report means and standard deviations from the
Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 that, under normality, imply that 4.1% of
those with an SAT score or ACT equivalent above 1300 have bottom-SES-quartile
parents.
40. Hoxby and Avery also require a self-reported grade point average of A−or
higher, but they note that the GPA restriction matters very little once they apply
the SAT/ACT restriction.

aid forms. Because of differences in household units and income
deﬁnitions across these sources, it is possible that Hoxby and Av-
ery’s approach would classify more than 25% of parents as falling
in the bottom 25% of the distribution.41 By contrast, because we
compute percentile thresholds and measure parental incomes us-
ing the same data, 25% of parents fall in the bottom 25% in our
analysis by construction.
Having established the relationship between test scores and
parental income, we now analyze how alternative allocations of
students to colleges would affect income segregation and inter-
generational mobility.
V.B. Income Segregation
We begin by evaluating the extent to which income segre-
gation across colleges can be explained by differences in aca-
demic credentials when students apply to college (as proxied
for by SAT or ACT scores), holding ﬁxed each college’s current
racial composition and the geographic origins of their students.
We impose the geographic and racial constraints to better approx-
imate feasible reallocations, recognizing that many institutions
(e.g., public state institutions, local community colleges, or histor-
ically black colleges and universities) effectively face geographic
or racial constraints in practice.42 This analysis provides a natural
benchmark to gauge the extent to which colleges’ student bodies
are representative of the underlying population of academically
qualiﬁed students from which they seek to draw. For example, are
the parental incomes of Ivy League students representative of all
students with similar test scores who come from the same states
and racial groups?
41. Hoxby and Avery classify a child as falling in the bottom quartile if the
child’s estimated family income lies below $41,472, the 25th percentile of family
income in the 2008 ACS. The income data they use in their analysis is based
on College Scholarship Service (CSS) Proﬁle family income data reported by the
student, which in turn comes from parents’ tax returns and supplementary infor-
mation. In the tax data, however, the 25th percentile of the adjusted gross income
distribution is about $25,000, well below the ACS threshold. In Online Appendix C,
we show that the differences between the tax data and the ACS are entirely at-
tributable to differences in the deﬁnition of household units and incomes.
42. The effects of our counterfactuals on aggregate segregation and mobility
actually turn out to be quite similar if we permit reallocations without any racial
or geographic constraints (Online Appendix Table XIV).

INCOME SEGREGATION AND INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY

To conduct this analysis, we ﬁrst record the actual vector of
SAT/ACT test scores at each college-by-state-by-race group −→s g.
We allocate students by ﬁlling each college-state-race’s slot for a
student with test score s with a random draw from the state-race’s
population of college students with test score s. In this “income-
neutral” student allocation regime, colleges continue to enroll
students based on both test scores and other credentials (e.g.,
recommendations, extracurriculars) but eliminate variation in
enrollment rates by parental income—whether due to differences
in application, admissions, or matriculation—among students
with comparable test scores in the same state and racial group.
Figure VI, Panel A shows how segregation across colleges
would change under this counterfactual. The left side of the ﬁgure
examines the extent to which students from low-income families
are exposed to students from high-income families by plotting the
fraction of college peers from the top quintile among college stu-
dents with parents in the bottom quintile. The right side anal-
ogously examines segregation among high-income students by
plotting the fraction of top-quintile peers for students from the
top quintile (see Online Appendix Table XIII for more statistics).
In each case, we plot three statistics: the actual rates in the data,
the rates under the income-neutral allocation counterfactual, and
the rates under need-afﬁrmative student allocations (which we
discuss below).
Segregation across colleges would fall substantially if college
enrollment were income neutral conditional on test scores: for ex-
ample, the top-quintile peer share of students from low-income
families would rise from 22.5% to 27.8%. Since 30.8% of college
students come from the top quintile (shown by the horizontal line
on the ﬁgure), a random allocation of students to colleges among
the current pool of college students would yield a top-quintile
peer share of 30.8%. Hence, income-neutral allocations would
close 63.9% of the gap between the current degree of exposure
that students from low-income families have to high-income stu-
dents and the exposure they would have if colleges were perfectly
integrated by income (conditional on the set of students who cur-
rently attend college). Put differently, only 36.1% of the income
segregation across colleges can be attributed to differences in stu-
dents’ test scores, racial backgrounds, or geographic origins. The
remaining 63.9% is driven by a combination of differences in stu-
dent application choices, college admissions, and matriculation
decisions by parental income conditional on these factors.

Impacts of Counterfactuals on Income Segregation and Intergenerational
Mobility
This ﬁgure shows how the income-neutral and need-afﬁrmative student allo-
cation counterfactuals affect income segregation across colleges and intergenera-
tional mobility. The income-neutral counterfactual allocates students to colleges
randomly based on their SAT/ACT scores while holding ﬁxed the distribution of
SAT/ACT scores, race, and precollege states to match the empirical distribution
at each college. The need-afﬁrmative student allocations counterfactual replicates
the income-neutral counterfactual after adding 160 points to the SAT/ACT scores
of all college-goers from the bottom parent income quintile, 128 points to second
quintile college-goers, 96 points to third quintile college-goers, and 64 points to
fourth quintile college-goers. See Section V.B for details on these counterfactuals.
Panel A plots the fraction of college peers from the top quintile among college stu-
dents with parents in the bottom quintile (left triplet of bars) and the top quintile
(right triplet of bars) in actuality and under the two counterfactuals. These statis-
tics are based on the subset of students who attend college in our analysis sample
(i.e., excluding those who do not attend college). The dashed horizontal line shows
the fraction of college students who come from the top quintile, which is the frac-
tion of top-quintile peers one would observe if students were randomly allocated to
colleges. See Online Appendix Table XIII for additional statistics on peer exposure
across colleges. Panel B plots the fraction of students from the bottom parental
income quintile in actuality and under the two counterfactuals at Ivy-Plus col-
leges, all selective colleges, and all unselective colleges. Selective tiers make up
the top six tiers listed in Table II, while unselective tiers make up the remaining
six tiers. Panel C plots the gap (percentage-point difference) in the fraction of chil-
dren who reach the top quintile between top-parent-income-quintile college-goers
and bottom-parent-income-quintile college-goers in actuality and under the two

FIGURE VI (Continued). counterfactuals. Brackets denote the share of the gap
narrowed under each counterfactual. The calculations in Panel C assume that
80% of children’s earnings differences across colleges reﬂect causal effects condi-
tional on SAT/ACT scores, parental income, and race; see Section V.C for details.
In Online Appendix Table XVI, we report results under alternative assumptions
about the causal share. This ﬁgure is constructed directly from the individual-level
microdata.
Although the income-neutral allocation reduces segregation
overall, it largely reshufﬂes students within selectivity tiers and
thus has smaller effects on parental income distributions at more
selective colleges. Figure VI, Panel B illustrates this result by
plotting the fraction of students from the bottom parental income
quintile at Ivy-Plus, selective colleges (top six tiers), and unselec-
tive colleges (bottom six tiers) in actuality and under the counter-
factual (see Table VI for statistics for each tier separately). The
bottom-quintile share of students at selective colleges overall rises
from 7.3% to 8.6%, closing 38% of the gap in their underrepresen-
tation relative to their 10.7% share of college goers overall. This
38% reduction in segregation at selective colleges is substantial,
but it is much smaller than the 64% reduction overall.
1. Impacts at Ivy-Plus Colleges.
The impacts of income-
neutral allocations at the most selective colleges differ from those
in the broader population. At Ivy-Plus colleges, the fraction of stu-
dents from the bottom quintile remains essentially unchanged un-
der income-neutral allocations in absolute terms (rising from 3.8%
to 4.4%), but the fraction of students from the middle class (the sec-
ond, third, and fourth income quintiles) rises sharply, from 27.8%
to 37.9%, as shown in Table VI. Figure V, Panel A shows why we
see the biggest effects on the representation of the middle class
by plotting the parental income distribution of high SAT/ACT
(≥1300) scorers alongside the parental income distribution of ac-
tual Ivy-Plus enrollees. Children from the bottom-quintile are rep-
resented at nearly the same rate as one would expect given their
test scores; children from the middle class are underrepresented
at these colleges; and those from the top quintile are overrepre-
sented.
Figure V, Panel B presents a more granular depiction of the
degree of over/underrepresentation by parental income. It plots
the share of students with an SAT/ACT score of 1400—the modal
and median test score among actual Ivy-Plus students—who at-
tend an Ivy-Plus college. Rather than a ﬂat line, which would have

Notes. This table reports parental income distributions by quintile by college tier. Panel A reports actual
parent income shares in the analysis sample (1980–82 birth cohorts). Each cell reports the share of the
speciﬁed group of colleges that comes from a given parent income quintile. The abbreviations are: “bot. 20%"
is the lowest quintile, “sel.” means “selective”, “pub.” means “public”, “priv.” means “private", “nonsel.” means
“nonselective”, “n.p.” means “nonproﬁt”, and “underrep.” means “underrepresentation”. The “Underrep. in
selective tiers” row reports the percentage difference between the number of students from the relevant
parent income quintile pooling the ﬁrst six tiers and the percentage of students from that quintile pooling
all colleges. For example in Panel A, 31.3% = 1- 7.3%
10.7% . Panel B repeats Panel A under our income-neutral
student allocation counterfactual, allocating students to colleges randomly based on their SAT/ACT scores
while holding ﬁxed the distribution of SAT/ACT scores, precollege states, and race to match the actual
distributions at each college. Panel C repeats Panel B after adding 160 points to the SAT/ACT scores of all
college-goers from the bottom parent income quintile, 128 points to second quintile college-goers, 96 points to
middle quintile college-goers, and 64 points to fourth quintile college-goers. See Section V.B for more details
on these counterfactuals. Statistics in this table are constructed directly from the individual-level microdata.
indicated that 1400-scorers from each parent income bin attend
an Ivy-Plus college at the same rate, we observe an asymmetric
U-shape, with higher attendance rates in the tails. In particu-
lar, 1400-scorers with parents from the top and bottom quintiles
attend Ivy-Plus colleges at 2.4 and 1.6 times the rate of middle-
quintile children with comparable test scores, respectively. We ﬁnd
similar patterns at other test score levels; see Online Appendix
Table XII.
The upshot of this analysis is that there is a “missing middle”
at Ivy-Plus institutions—an underrepresentation of students with
high test scores from middle class families relative to students
from low-income and especially high-income families. Changes
in application or admissions policies that eliminate existing dif-
ferences in attendance rates conditional on test scores across
parental income groups could therefore signiﬁcantly increase the
representation of the middle class (though not low-income) fami-
lies at the nation’s most selective private colleges.43
43. This conclusion differs from that of Carnevale et al. (2019), who report
that high-socioeconomic-status (a composite of parent income, education, and

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
Of course, test scores are an imperfect proxy for academic
credentials, and colleges weigh many factors (e.g., extracurric-
ulars, overall ﬁt) beyond academic qualiﬁcations in admissions
decisions. Therefore, one cannot interpret the counterfactual esti-
mates as representing income segregation under a “meritocracy.”
Nevertheless, we view this counterfactual as a natural benchmark
to gauge the extent to which student bodies are representative of
the underlying population of academically qualiﬁed students. If
one’s objective is to have income-neutral enrollment conditional
on merit, deviations from this benchmark can be justiﬁed at cur-
rent selectivity levels only if other non-test-score determinants of
merit are correlated with parent income.44
2. Need-Afﬁrmative Student Allocations.
Although a system
of applications and admissions that is income-neutral conditional
on academic credentials would reduce income segregation signif-
icantly, the fraction of students from the bottom income quintile
would remain about 50% higher at unselective colleges than at
selective colleges. We therefore now turn to ask how much of a
preference one would need to give children from lower-income
backgrounds in the student allocation process—or, equivalently,
how much lower-income students’ test scores would have to rise—
to fully eliminate segregation across colleges.
We simulate need-afﬁrmative student allocations by adding
sq points to the SAT/ACT scores of children with parents from
occupation prestige) shares at highly selective colleges would barely change under
a system in which students with the highest test scores are admitted to the most
selective colleges, without regard to other credentials. This is because the stu-
dents with the very highest SAT/ACT scores tend to come from the highest-income
families. Although Carnevale et al.’s pure test-score-admissions counterfactual
also achieves income neutrality conditional on test scores, it increases the selec-
tivity of elite colleges, because elite colleges currently admit many students who
have SAT scores well below 1600. Our point is that shifting to a system that is
income-neutral conditional on the current distribution of test scores at elite col-
leges (thereby preserving current levels of selectivity) would substantially reduce
top income shares.
44. It may be useful to consider an analogy to the principle of “disparate
impact” in antidiscrimination law. Any hiring practice (e.g., requiring candidates
to excel at squash) that has a disparate (differential) impact by gender or race
is prima facie evidence of unlawful discrimination and shifts the burden of proof
to the employer to show that the practice is consistent with business necessity
and has no practical and more neutral alternative. Disparate impact by parental
income is not a legal concern, but it would be of analogous interest to those seeking
a system of college admissions that is income-neutral conditional on merit.

income quintile q < 5. We vary the values of {sq}, leaving
SAT/ACT scores for children from the top quintile unchanged (s5
= 0), to identify a proﬁle of test score increases that results in a
constant parental income distribution across all college selectivity
tiers. We then renorm test scores to match the actual distribution
and replicate the income-neutral allocation above with these ad-
justed scores (see Online Appendix J for details).
Iterating over linearly declining proﬁles of {sq}, we ﬁnd that
adding 160 SAT points for those from the bottom quintile (s1 =
160) and sq = (1 −q−1
5 )160 for q = 2, 3, 4—that is, increments of
80%, 60%, and 40% of the bottom-quintile increment—produces
roughly equal parental income shares across tiers.45 To under-
stand the practical implications of such an increment, note that
7.3% of children from the bottom parental income quintile with
an SAT score of 1400 attend an Ivy-Plus college in our data. Such
students would attend Ivy-Plus schools at a rate of 25.8% in our
need-afﬁrmative 160-point SAT increment scenario. More gener-
ally, among students with SAT scores above 1300, the 160-point
increment increases the likelihood of attending an Ivy-Plus col-
lege for a bottom-income-quintile student conditional on their SAT
score by a factor of 3.54 on average.
It is instructive to gauge the magnitude of these increments
in SAT scores and attendance rates for low-income students by
comparing them to admissions preferences currently granted to
other groups. Espenshade, Chung, and Walling (2004) use admis-
sions data from three elite private colleges to evaluate the extent
to which legacies, athletes, and underrepresented minorities are
more likely to be admitted, controlling for their credentials at the
point of application. They ﬁnd that the increase in admissions
probability for these groups is roughly equivalent to the effect
of a 160-point increase in SAT scores.46 Similarly, Arcidiacono,
Kinsler, and Ransom (2019) use data from Harvard to estimate
45. That is, the following groups are treated identically within state-race
groups: (s+160)-scorers with bottom-20% parents, (s+128)-scorers with second-
quintile parents, (s+96)-scorers with middle-quintile parents, (s+64)-scorers with
fourth-quintile parents, and s-scorers with top-quintile parents. Changes in ad-
mission probabilities can change applicant pools (e.g., Yagan 2016); our linear
gradient reﬂects the combined effect of application, admission, and matriculation.
46. More precisely, Espenshade, Chung, and Walling estimate that legacy
status is equivalent to 160 SAT/ACT points, recruited athlete status 200 points,
African American status 230 points, and Hispanic status 185 points. Hurwitz
(2011) also ﬁnds large observed admissions advantages for legacy applicants.

that students who are recruited athletes, legacies, those on the
dean’s interest list, or children of faculty and staff (ALDCs) have
admissions rates 3.4 times higher than non-ALDC students with
otherwise similar characteristics.47 Hence, one way to implement
our need-afﬁrmative counterfactual could be to grant preference
in admissions for lower-income students similar to that currently
given to other groups. Another approach may be to increase appli-
cation or matriculation rates for lower-income students relative
to high-income students by an equivalent amount.
Figure VI, Panel A shows that this degree of need-afﬁrmative
student reallocation essentially desegregates the higher edu-
cation system fully, with exposure rates to students from dif-
ferent income groups similar to what one would obtain under
a random allocation benchmark.48 Moreover, need-afﬁrmative
allocations would essentially eliminate differences in parental in-
come distributions across all selectivity tiers. The fraction of stu-
dents from bottom-quintile families is close to the overall mean
across all colleges of 10.7% in all college tiers (Figure VI, Panel B;
Table VI, Panel C). Indeed, the Ivy-Plus colleges would have a
higher fraction of children from low-income families than almost
all other tiers in this scenario.49 Each tier still has more students
from high-income families than low-income families even with
need-afﬁrmative allocations because college attendance rates rise
sharply with parental income (Figure I) and our counterfactual
does not change who attends college. However, among the current
pool of college students, treating those from low-income families
like legacy students would make parental income distributions
similar across all colleges.
47. Table 10 of Arcidiacono, Kinsler, and Ransom (2019) reports counterfactual
admissions rates for admitted ALDC students, removing the ALDC preferences,
separately for students of each race. Averaging these counterfactual admissions
rates across racial groups using the number of admitted ALDCs from each race
(reported in the same table) yields 29.4%, implying admissions rather that are
1
29.4% = 3.4 times higher for ALDCs than otherwise similar non-ALDCs.
48. We present results with alternative increments to SAT/ACT scores in
Online Appendix Figure VIII.
49. Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin (2006, chapter 7) examine the effects of
need-afﬁrmative allocations on parental income distributions at 18 elite colleges.
Our ﬁndings are qualitatively consistent with their results at these 18 colleges,
although our quantitative results differ because their self-reported parent income
measures yield low-income shares at elite colleges that are twice as large as ours.

V.C. Intergenerational Mobility
1.
Estimating
Colleges’
Value-Added.
To
quantify
how
changes in the allocation of students to colleges would affect in-
tergenerational mobility, we ﬁrst need estimates of how children’s
earnings outcomes would change if they were to attend different
colleges (i.e., colleges’ causal effects or “value-added”). Directly
estimating each college’s value-added would require a source of
quasi-experimental variation at each college and is outside the
scope of this article. Instead, we build on the prior literature and
use estimates that are consistent with that work as an input into
our simulations.
We begin from our estimates of children’s mean earning ranks
conditional on their parental income, race, and SAT/ACT scores
estimated already.50 We then estimate the fraction λ of these con-
ditional earnings differences across colleges that is due to causal
effects versus selection by controlling for observable characteris-
tics and for the set of colleges to which a student applied to capture
selection on unobservables, following Dale and Krueger (2002).
Formally, consider the regression model
(1)
yiqc = α + βXiqc + f (Si) + f (pq) + θr + δc + εiqc,
where yiqc is the earnings rank of student i from parent income
rank q who attended college c; Xiqc is a vector of observed student-
speciﬁc characteristics; f(Si) is a quintic in the student’s SAT or
ACT equivalent score, an indicator for taking the SAT, and an
indicator for taking the ACT (note that some students took both
tests); f(pq) is a quintic in the student’s parent income rank; θr is
a race ﬁxed effect, and δc is a college ﬁxed effect. We can estimate
the vector of college ﬁxed effects c = {δc} using a variety of con-
trol vectors Xiqc. First consider estimates where Xiqc is empty and
thus the only controls are SAT/ACT scores, parent income, and
race; denote these estimates by S,p,r
c
. We can then assess the re-
lationship between these test-score-and-parent-income-and-race
controlled estimates of colleges’ effects with estimates that in-
clude additional controls by running the regression

50. We do not condition on children’s precollege state because of small sam-
ples; in particular, under need-afﬁrmative allocations, cells can be small when
counterfactually high or low SAT/ACT scorers are assigned to a given college.

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
The parameter λ gives an estimate of the fraction of the base-
line test-score-and-parent-income-and-race-controlled difference
between any two colleges that would remain, on average, with the
addition of further controls. If latent student quality is not corre-
lated with the college he or she attends conditional on the observed
characteristics X, the parameter λ can be interpreted as the frac-
tion of the differences between colleges’ earnings estimates S,p,r
c
that reﬂects their causal effects (value-added).
Table VII reports estimates of λ using a range of control vec-
tors X.51 Columns (1)–(3) control successively for the following
observable student characteristics: interactions between gender,
race, and the test score quintic; high-school ﬁxed effects; and high-
school ﬁxed effects interacted with race. These speciﬁcations all
yield estimates of λ > 0.9, that is, more than 90% of the base-
line earnings variation (conditional on parental income, race, and
test scores) reﬂects a causal effect if these observables capture
selection.
To assess whether selection on other unobservable dimen-
sions might confound our estimates, we use the set of colleges
to which students apply as controls for their latent ability, as in
Dale and Krueger (2002, 2014).52 In Table VII, column (4), we
follow Dale and Krueger (2014) and control for mean SAT score
of the colleges to which students send their SAT/ACT scores (a
proxy for college application) and the total number of colleges
to which they send their scores in addition to the observable
characteristics used in column (2). Column (5) adds high-school
ﬁxed effects interacted with race to column (4), while column (6)
limits the sample to students in the bottom quintile of the in-
come distribution.53 These speciﬁcations all yield point estimates
51. We exclude students who do not attend any college and omit students with
imputed test scores from these regressions.
52. Controlling for the set of colleges to which students apply is what Dale
and Krueger (2002) call a “self-revelation” approach to adjusting for selection; they
show that this approach yields estimates that are very similar to speciﬁcations that
control for the set of colleges to which students are admitted. Dale and Krueger
(2014) simply control for the application set rather than the admittance set to
maximize power in light of this result, and we follow that approach here (since we
do not have data on admissions).
53. As the estimate in column (6) indicates, we do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant het-
erogeneity in λ across parental income groups. However, the baseline conditional
earnings differences from attending a more selective college are larger for stu-
dents from low-income families. In particular, we replicate Dale and Krueger’s

Notes. Dependent variable: college ﬁxed effect, conditional on parent income, race, SAT/ACT, and additional controls. This table reports estimates of the fraction of the differences
in mean earnings observed across colleges conditional on parental income, race, and SAT/ACT scores that are due to causal effects, corresponding to the parameter λ in equation (2).
The sample comprises all college-goers in our 1980–82 cohorts who are matched to College Board or ACT data. Each column presents coefﬁcients from univariate OLS regressions
run at the college level, weighted by child count, following equation (2). The independent variable in all columns is the college ﬁxed effect obtained from a regression of child earnings
rank on college ﬁxed effects, a quintic in parent income percentile, a quintic in SAT/ACT score, an indicator for taking the SAT, an indicator for taking the ACT (some took both tests),
and race/ethnicity indicators, as in equation (1). The dependent variable in each column is the child’s college’s ﬁxed effect from the same regression, including additional controls. In
column (1), we add a gender indicator, and we fully interact the race, gender, and SAT-quintic. Column (2) adds ﬁxed effects for the child’s high school. Column (3) interacts the high
school and race indicators. Column (4) replicates column (2) and controls for the mean SAT score of the colleges to which students sent scores and also the total number of colleges
to which the students sent scores, as in Dale and Krueger (2014). Column (5) replicates column (3), adding the same controls as in column (4). Column (6) replicates column (5),
restricting attention to children with parents from the bottom quintile. Statistics in this table are constructed directly from the individual-level microdata.

of λ ⩾0.85, with a lower bound on the 95% conﬁdence interval of
around 0.82.54
Given these estimates, we assume that λ = 80% of the con-
ditional earnings differences observed across colleges are due to
causal effects (value-added) and the remaining 20% is due to se-
lection in our baseline simulations.55 Importantly, we also assume
that these estimated causal effects do not change under our coun-
terfactual student reallocations, in particular ignoring potential
changes in value-added that may arise from having a different
group of students (peer effects).
2. Income-Neutral Student Allocations.
We construct a
counterfactual earnings distribution for children at each college
based on the observed distribution of earnings for children in each
parent income quintile, SAT/ACT score level, race, and college.
Mechanically, children are randomly assigned the earnings of
another child who is observed as attending their counterfactually
assigned college and who has the same parent income quintile,
race, and SAT/ACT score with 80% probability and are assigned
their actual earnings with 20% probability (reﬂecting our 80%
causal effect assumption). Because this reallocation changes the
aggregate distribution of children’s earnings in adulthood, we
then recompute quintile earnings thresholds based on the new
aggregate earnings distribution when computing mobility rates.56
Table VIII shows how the intergenerational transition matrix
for college students would change under this counterfactual. Panel
result that the return to attending a college with higher average SAT scores is
small on average but larger for low-income students in Online Appendix Table XV.
54. In their College and Beyond sample, Dale and Krueger ﬁnd that control-
ling for the application set reduces the coefﬁcient on mean SAT scores substan-
tially even after controlling for student’s own SAT scores and other observables.
We believe our ﬁndings differ because we have more precise controls for student
background (e.g., a precise measure of parental income rather than a proxy) and
because students’ own SAT scores may be a stronger predictor of outcomes today
than for students who attended college in the 1970s and 1980s.
55. To further validate this approach, we compare our estimates to the re-
gression discontinuity estimates of Zimmerman (2014), who essentially estimates
the causal effect of attending Florida International University versus Miami
Dade College. Our estimates based on the approach outlined here are similar to
Zimmerman’s quasi-experimental estimates.
56. We take non-college-goers’ earnings as ﬁxed, ignoring the possibility of
equilibrium effects on their earnings. We obtain nearly identical results if we do
not recompute the thresholds.

Notes. Panel A shows the actual intergenerational income transition matrix for college students in our
analysis sample (1980–82 birth cohorts). Each cell of Panel A reports the percentage of college-goers with
earnings outcomes in the quintile given by the column conditional on having parents with income in the
quintile given by the row for the analysis sample. Panels B and C repeat Panel A under the income-neutral
student allocation and need-afﬁrmative student allocation counterfactuals, deﬁned in the notes to Table VI.
Panels B and C assume that 80% of children’s earnings differences across colleges reﬂect causal effects
conditional on SAT/ACT scores, race, and parental income. Mechanically, children are randomly assigned
the earnings of another child who is observed as attending their counterfactually assigned college and who
has the same parent income quintile, race, and SAT/ACT score. After that counterfactual earnings level
is calculated, with 80% probability, children are assigned that randomly assigned earning, and with 20%
probability, children are assigned their actual earnings. See Online Appendix J for details. The share of the
rich-poor top-quintile outcome gap narrowed equals ((40.2%−18.2%)−(38.3%−19.5%))
(40.2%−18.2%)
= 14.6% in Panel B. The
corresponding statistic in Panel C is computed similarly. Statistics in this table are constructed directly from
the individual-level microdata.
A shows the actual transition matrix. For example, the chance of
reaching the top earnings quintile ranges from 18.2% for chil-
dren with parents in the bottom quintile to 40.2% for children
with parents in the top quintile, as shown in the ﬁfth column of

Table VIII, Panel A. This difference of 22 percentage points is
plotted in the ﬁrst bar in Figure VI, Panel C.
The second bar of Figure VI, Panel C shows how this gap
would change under the income-neutral allocation counterfactual.
The chance of reaching the top quintile now ranges from 19.5%
to 38.3% across parent income quintiles (Table VIII, Panel B),
a gap that is 14.6% smaller than the empirically observed gap.
The gap in children’s chances of reaching the top 1% between
children from low-income and high-income families falls from 2.8
percentage points to 2.3 percentage points, a similar reduction in
percentage terms (Table VIII). Likewise, the correlation between
parents’ and children’s income ranks among college students falls
by 15% under the counterfactual. In sum, the intergenerational
persistence of income would fall by about 15% if students were
allocated to colleges based purely on their qualiﬁcations at the
point of application (as proxied for by SAT/ACT scores).
3. Need-Afﬁrmative Student Allocations.
To compute stu-
dents’ earnings distributions under need-afﬁrmative allocations,
we follow the same approach as above, using students’ actual
SAT/ACT scores (rather than adjusted SAT/ACT scores) in the
earnings rank reallocation. This approach means that the test
score increment granted in the admissions process does not af-
fect students’ earnings outcomes aside from the college that they
attend.
Under need-afﬁrmative allocations, the chance of reaching
the top quintile ranges from 20.8% to 37.0% across parent income
quintiles (Table VIII, Panel C), 26.5% smaller than the empiri-
cally observed gap (Figure VI, Panel C). The correlation between
parents’ and children’s income ranks falls by 25%. The gap in
children’s chances of reaching the top 1% between children from
low-income and high-income families falls from 2.8 percentage
points to 1.9 percentage points, a 32.6% reduction. The impact on
children’s chances of reaching the upper tail is particularly large
because need-afﬁrmative allocations sharply change the distribu-
tion of parental incomes at the most selective private colleges,
whose students are especially likely to reach the upper tail, as
shown in Section IV.
Need-afﬁrmative reallocation has nearly twice as large an ef-
fect on mobility rates as income-neutral reallocation because it
enables low-income students to attend the highest value-added
colleges. The value-added of the colleges that students from low-
versus high-income families attend is essentially equalized under

need-afﬁrmative allocations. The difference in the value-added
of the colleges attended by students from the top versus bottom
parent income quintile (estimated as described above) falls by
89% relative to the empirically observed difference of 4.5 per-
centiles. By contrast, income-neutral allocations reduce the gap
in college value-added by parental income much less, by only 47%
relative to the empirically observed difference. Intuitively, this is
because income-neutral allocations tend to reshufﬂe low-income
students across colleges in the same tier as shown above, whereas
need-afﬁrmative allocations enable low-income students to get
into higher value-added colleges in higher selectivity tiers.
4. Alternative Assumptions about Causal Effects.
In Online
Appendix Table XVI, we vary our assumption about the fraction of
the difference in earnings across colleges conditional on parental
income, race, and SAT/ACT scores that is due to causal effects
from θ = 100% (pure causal effects, no selection) to θ = 0% (pure
selection, no causal effects). At the upper bound (θ = 100%),
need-afﬁrmative allocations would reduce the intergenerational
persistence of income by 33%. The simulated impact mechanically
decreases to 0% at the lower bound of θ = 0%. Assuming that
θ > 50%—roughly the lower bound of the 95% conﬁdence interval
implied by comparing Zimmerman’s (2014) estimate to ours—one
could reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by at
least 17% (among children who attend college) purely by chang-
ing the allocation of students to colleges, without attempting to
change any college’s production function.57 These are substantial
effects given that gaps in intergenerational mobility emerge
from an accumulation of exposure to different environments
and schools throughout childhood (Chetty and Hendren 2018).
Because colleges account for less than a quarter of the time most
children spend in formal education, one would not expect effects
on mobility much larger than 25% purely from changes in higher
education.
57. An alternative possibility is that the ratio of selection effects versus
causal effects is heterogeneous by parent income, with larger causal effects of
attending an elite college for children from lower-income families. In Online
Appendix Table XVII, we consider a scenario in which causal effects are 0 for
reallocations in selective colleges (the top six tiers) for students with parents in
the top four quintiles, 40% for reallocations in selective colleges for students with
parents in the bottom quintile, and 80% for all other reallocations. In this scenario,
need-afﬁrmative allocations would reduce the intergenerational persistence of in-
come by 21.3%.

VI. CONCLUSION
Using data covering nearly all college students in the United
States from 1999 to 2013, we constructed new college-level statis-
tics on two key inputs necessary for understanding how the al-
location of students to colleges affects intergenerational mobility:
(i) parental income distributions and (ii) children’s earnings in
adulthood conditional on parent income. We used these statistics
to establish two sets of empirical results. First, parental income
segregation across colleges is approximately as large as parental
income segregation across the neighborhoods in which children
grow up. Second, children of low- and high-income parents who
attend the same college have relatively similar earnings outcomes,
but children from high-income families are much more likely to
attend colleges with high earnings outcomes.
Combining these college-level statistics with data on stu-
dents’ SAT and ACT scores, we ﬁnd that allocating students
to colleges in an income-neutral way conditional on their test
scores would increase the representation of students from low-
and middle-income families at selective colleges substantially,
holding ﬁxed the racial composition and geographic origins of
their students. At the most selective (Ivy-Plus) colleges, the frac-
tion of students from the middle class would rise substantially,
although there would be little absolute change in the fraction
of students from the bottom income quintile because so few of
them currently have sufﬁciently high SAT/ACT scores. Under
the assumption that 80% of the difference in earnings premia
(conditional on parental income, race, and state) are causal, our
simulations imply that income-neutral allocations of students
to colleges (conditional on test scores) would itself reduce the
intergenerational persistence of income by 15%.
To go further, we simulate the consequences of raising lower-
income students’ test scores or granting them a preference in the
admissions process similar to that currently given to legacy or
minority students at elite private colleges. Such a change would
essentially eliminate income segregation across all college tiers
and reduce the intergenerational persistence of income by about
25%. We conclude that feasible changes in the allocation of stu-
dents to colleges could increase intergenerational mobility sub-
stantially without any changes to existing educational programs,
suggesting value in further efforts to enable students from low-
and middle-income families to attend colleges that offer better
earnings outcomes.
