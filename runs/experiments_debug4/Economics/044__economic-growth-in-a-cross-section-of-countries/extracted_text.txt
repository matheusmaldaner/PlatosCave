ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A CROSS SECTION  
OF COUNTRIES"  
For 98 countries in the period 1960-1985, the growth rate of real per capita 
GDP is positively related to initial human capital (proxied by 1960 school- 
enrollment rates) and negatively related to the initial (1960) level of real per capita 
GDP. Countries with higher human capital also have lower fertility rates and higher 
ratios of physical investment to GDP. Growth is inversely related to the share of 
government consumption in GDP, but insignificantly related to the share of public 
investment. Growth rates are positively related to measures of political stability and 
inversely related to a proxy for market distortions. 
In neoclassical growth models, such as Solow [19561, Cass 
[19651, and Koopmans [1965], a country's per capita growth rate 
tends to be inversely related to its starting level of income per 
person. In particular, if countries are similar with respect to 
structural parameters for preferences and technology, then poor 
countries tend to grow faster than rich countries. Thus, there is a 
force that promotes convergence in levels of per capita income 
across countries.' 
The main element behind the convergence result in neoclassi- 
cal growth models is diminishing returns to reproducible capital. 
Poor countries, with low ratios of capital to labor, have high 
marginal products of capital and thereby tend to grow at high 
rates.' This tendency for low-income countries to grow at high 
rates is reinforced in extensions of the neoclassical models that 
allow for international mobility of capital and technology. 
The hypothesis that poor countries tend to grow faster than 
rich countries seems to be inconsistent with the cross-country 
evidence, which indicates that per capita growth rates have little 
*Anearlier version of this paper was presented at the Institute for the Study of 
Free Enterprise Systems' Conference on Human Capital and Economic Growth, 
SUNY, Buffalo, May 1989. I am ateful for suggestions from Olivier Blanchard and

1. Barro and Sala i Martin [1990] show that the tendency for poor countries to 
grow faster than rich countries, termed P-convergence, need not imply a reduction 
in the dispersion of income levels, termed u-convergence, if each country's level of 
income is continually subject to random disturbances. The present study deals only 
with P-convergence. 
2. This property holds unambiguously for the capital stock in the Cass 
[1965]-Koopmans [I9651 model if the elasticity of marginal utility is constant. It 
also holds unambiguously for output if the production function is Cobb-Douglas. See 
Barro and Sala i Martin [1991].

correlation with the starting level of per capita product. Figure I, 
which uses the data from the Summers and Heston [I9881 
international comparison project, shows this type of relationship 
for 98 countries. The average growth rate of per capita real gross 
domestic product (GDP) from 1960 to 1985 (denoted GR6085) is 
not significantly related to the 1960 value of real per capita GDP 
(GDPGO); the correlation is 0.09.3 This finding accords with recent 
models, such as Lucas [I9881 and Rebelo [19901, that assume 
constant returns to a broad concept of reproducible capital, which 
includes human capital. In these models the growth rate of per 
capita product is independent of the starting level of per capita 
product. 
Human capital plays a special role in a number of models of 
endogenous economic growth. In Romer [I9901 human capital is

the key input to the research sector, which generates the new 
products or ideas that underlie technological progress. Thus, 
countries with greater initial stocks of human capital experience a 
more rapid rate of introduction of new goods and thereby tend to 
grow faster. In multicountry models of technological change, the 
spread of new ideas across countries (or firms or industries) is also 
important. As Nelson and Phelps [I9661 suggested, a larger stock 
of human capital makes it easier for a country to absorb the new 
products or ideas that have been discovered elsewhere. Therefore, a 
follower country with more human capital tends to grow faster 
because it catches up more rapidly to the technological leader. 
Becker, Murphy, and Tamura [I9901 assume that the rate of 
return on human capital increases over some range, an effect that 
could arise because of the spillover benefits from human capital 
that Lucas [19881 stresses. As an example, the return to some 
kinds of ability, such as talent in communications, is higher if other 
people are also more able. In this setting, increases in the quantity 
of human capital per person tend to lead to higher rates of 
investment in human and physical capital, and hence, to higher per 
capita growth. A supporting force is that more human capital per 
person reduces fertility rates, because human capital is more 
productive in producing goods and additional human capital rather 
than more children. 
The empirical enalysis in this paper uses school-enrollment 
rates as proxies for human capital. For a given starting value of per 
capita GDP, a country's subsequent growth rate is positively 
related to these measures of initial human capital. Moreover, given 
the human-capital variables, subsequent growth is substantially 
negatively related to the initial level of per capita GDP. Thus, in 
this modified sense, the data support the convergence hypothesis of 
neoclassical growth models. A poor country tends to grow faster 
than a rich country, but only for a given quantity of human capital; 
that is, only if the poor country's human capital exceeds the 
amount that typically accompanies the low level of per capita 
income.

which I have been able to assemble data on the variables em- 
ployed). Because heteroskedasticity could be important across 
countries, the standard errors for the coefficients are based on 
White's [I9801 heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix. 
These standard errors do not differ greatly, however, from those 
obtained by ordinary least squares. The table also includes regres- 
sions in which the observations are weighted in accordance with 
the levels of per capita GDP or population. 
The data are from Summers and Heston [1988], the United 
Nations, the World Bank, Banks's [I9791 data base, and some 
other sources. Barro and Wolf [I9891 provide details on the data 
set.4 Means and standard deviations appear in Appendix 1; defini- 
tions for all variables appear in Appendix 2; and a list of countries is 
in Appendix 3. For the moment, I shall concentrate on results 
related to the initial (1960) values of per capita GDP and the 
human capital proxies. The other variables, discussed later, are not 
strongly correlated with these variables. 
The two main proxies for human capital are the 1960 values of 
school-enrollment rates at the secondary (SECGO) and primary 
levels (PRIM60).5 These variables, based on information from the 
United Nations, measure number of students enrolled in the 
designated grade levels relative to the total population of the 
corresponding age group. (Because of this definition it is possible 
for the values to exceed 1.0.) With these school-enrollment rates 
(and, less importantly, the other explanatory variables) held 
constant, the estimated coefficient on starting per capita product, 
GDPGO, in regression 1of Table I is negative and highly significant: 
-0.0075, s.e. = 0.0012. Because GDPGO is measured in thousands 
of 1980 U. S. dollars, the result means that an increase in per capita 
real GDP by $1,000 lowers the real per capita growth rate 
(GR6085) by 0.75 percentage points per year. 
Figure I1 plots GR6085, net of the value predicted by all 
explanatory variables except GDPGO, versus GDPGO. That is, the 
figure shows the partial correlation between GR6085 and GDPGO. 
In contrast with Figure I, the relationship is now strongly negative: 
4. To receive a description of the data set and a data diskette, write to Holger 
Wolf, National Bureau of Economic Research, 1050 Massachusetts Avenue, Cam- 
bridge, MA 02138. 
5. It would be better to use proxies for the initial stock of human capital per 
person rather than variables that relate to the flow of investment in human capital. 
The stock of human capital derived from formal education depends on current and 
lagged values of school-enrollment rates. In the subsequent discussion I consider 
effects from lagged values of the school-enrollment variables.

regression 1of Table I) 
the correlation is -0.74. Thus, the results indicate that-holding 
constant a set of variables that includes proxies for starting human 
capital-higher 
initial per capita GDP is substantially negatively 
related to subsequent per capita growth. The sample range of 
variation in GDPGO (in 1980 U. S. dollars) from $208 to $7,380 
"explains" a spread in average per capita growth rates of about five 
percentage points. (The sample range in per capita growth rates is 
-0.017 to 0.074, with a mean of 0.022.) 
Regression 2 in Table I adds the square of GDP6O; that is, 
instead of a linear form, the relation between GR6085 and GDPGO 
is now quadratic. The estimated coefficient of the square term is 
positive but only marginally significant (t-value = 1.41, and the 
coefficient on the linear term remains significantly negative (t- 
value = 3.6). A positive coefficient on the square term means that 
the force toward convergence (negative relation between growth 


--- Page 11 ---

and level) attenuates as per capita GDP rises. The point estimates 
imply that the relation between growth and level is negative 
(holding constant the other variables) only if real per capita GDP is 
less than $10,800. All values for GDPGO in the sample are below 
this figure, but values for several of the industrialized countries 
exceeded this amount after 1960. For example, the U. S. real per 
capita GDP surpassed $10,800 in 1977.= 
In the basic neoclassical model-which 
incorporates diminish- 
ing returns to capital-the 
growth rate tends to be inversely 
related to the absolute level of initial per capita GDP. On the other 
hand, models that involve the spread of technology or the mobility 
of factors involve the level of per capita GDP in relation to the 
levels in other countries. The present cross-section results cannot 
distinguish between absolute and relative per capita GDP. This 
distinction would be feasible, in principle, in a study that also 
exploited the time-series variation in the data. However, one 
difficulty in this extension is that many of the variables, such as 
school-enrollment rates, are unavailable in a full time series. 
Regressions 1and 2 of Table I indicate that per capita growth 
is positively related to the proxies for initial human capital, holding 
fixed GDP6O and the other variables. The estimated coefficients of 
SEC6O and PRIM60 are individually significantly different from 
zero, with t-values in regression 1of 3.8 and 4.4, respectively. A 
joint test for the significance of the two school-enrollment variables 
leads to the statistic, F2,, = 18.5. 
Figure I11 shows the relationship between the per capita 
growth rate, net of the value predicted by the regressors other than 
the school-enrollment variables, and a linear combination of 
SEC6O and PRIMGO. (The variable on the horizontal axis is 
0.0305 x SEC6O + 0.0250 x PRIMGO, corresponding to the coeffi- 
cients estimated in regression 1of Table I.) The partial correlation 
of GR6085 with the human capital proxy is 0.73, compared with a 
simple correlation of 0.43. Figure IV shows the simple relation 
between GR6805 and the human capital measure. 
Figure I11 shows that the sample range of the human capital 
proxy "explains" a range of variation in per capita growth rates of 
about five percentage points; that is, roughly the same range as 
6. For values of GDP6O above $10,800, the quadratic implies a positive relation 
between level and growth, but the true relation may remain close to zero. That is, 
the quadratic can be viewed as an approximation to a functional form that 
asymptotically approaches a zero relation between growth and level, with the 
relation coming close to zero when real GDP is above about $10,000.

(from regression 1of Table I) 
that related to GDPGO in Figure 11. Thus, given the strong positive 
correlation (0.77) between GDPGO and the human capital measure, 
the results are consistent with the lack of a simple correlation 
between GR6085 and GDPGO, as shown in Figure I. Increases in 
initial GDP per capita that are accompanied by the typical increase 
in human capital per person are not systematically related to 
subsequent growth. But increases in initial GDP per capita with 
human capital held fixed are strongly negatively related to subse- 
quent growth. Similarly, increases in human capital with GDPGO 
held fixed are strongly positively related to subsequent growth. 
The results can be highlighted by noting three kinds of 
situations in which an imbalance between GDP per capita and 
human capital leads to significant effects on subsequent growth 
rates. Many of the Pacific rim countries have initial (1960) 
school-enrollment rates that are high relative to those typically

(0.0305*SEC60 + 0.0250*PRIM60) 
associated with the initial value of real GDP per capita. For 
example, for Japan the value of SEC6O is 0.74, compared with the 
value of 0.31 that would be predicted from a regression of SECGO 
on a quadratic function of GDP6O. For Korea and Taiwan the 
values of PRIM60 are 0.94 and 0.96, respectively, compared with 
the corresponding predicted values of 0.61 and 0.66. According to 
regression 1 in Table I, the relatively high values for initial 
school-enrollment rates raised the estimated growth rates by 0.015 
for Japan, 0.014 for Korea, and 0.012 for Taiwan. With this effect 
included, the fitted value of the growth rate for Japan, 0.057, is 
close to the actual value of 0.058. For Korea and Taiwan the 
adjustments are in the right direction but are insufficient to 
explain the high rates of growth: for Korea the fitted value is 0.037, 
and the actual is 0.060; whereas for Taiwan the fitted value is 0.041 
and the actual is 0.057. 
The typical country in sub-Saharan Africa has 1960 school- 


--- Page 14 ---
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A CROSS SECTION OF COUNTRIES 419 
enrollment rates that are low relative to the values associated with 
1960 per capita GDP in the full sample. This pattern likely reflects 
physical capital from the colonial era that is high in relation to the 
amount of initial human capital, as well as relatively high quanti- 
ties of natural resources. For example, the relatively low values for 
school enrollment reduced the estimated growth rates by 0.012 for 
Ethiopia (fitted value for growth of 0.001 versus an actual of 
0.003), 0.01 1for Sudan (fitted value for growth of -0.003, actual of 
-0.008), and by 0.011 for Senegal (fitted value for growth of 0.004, 
actual of 0.000). Given the remaining explanatory power of a 
dummy variable for Africa, as discussed later, it may be that the 
present specification does not capture this effect fully. 
Finally, the oil-exporting countries typically have high values 
of GDP6O relative to their 1960 school-enrollment rates. The 
sample includes six members of OPEC: Algeria, Gabon, Indonesia, 
Nigeria, Iran, and Vene~uela.~ 
For Gabon the school-enrollment 
rates are higher than would be predicted from GDPGO (which helps 
to explain Gabon's high growth rate), and for Indonesia the 
discrepancies are small. For the other four oil countries the 
shortfalls of the school-enrollment rates from the predicted values 
reduce the estimated growth rate by an average of 0.012. Except for 
Iran this effect improves the fit for growth rates. 
B. Measurement Errors and Related Issues 
Romer [I9891 notes that a result such as that shown in Figure 
I1 would be sensitive to measurement error in GDP. If there is 
temporary measurement error, future growth rates of GDP will 
automatically have a negative correlation with the starting level. 
For this effect to account for the findings, however, measurement 
error has to be very large, as well as temporary. For example, a 10 
percent error in GDP that is corrected over the subsequent 25 
years affects the computed annual average growth rate by only 
-0.004. This value contrasts with the range of variation of about 
0.05 that GDPGO appears to explain. For analogous reasons, 
business-cycle fluctuations in GDP could not explain very much of 
the results. 
If measurement error in GDP were short lived, no serious 
7. My earlier study [Barro, 19891deleted the oil countries ,but the inclusion of 
measures of human capital makes it feasible to incorporate these countries into the 
sample. The human-capital variables indicate that the oil countries are typically less 
advanced than would be suggested by the level of per capital GDP. 


--- Page 15 ---

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 
estimation problem would arise in the relation between the 1960 
level of per capita GDP and, say, the average growth rate of per 
capita GDP from 1970 to 1985 (GR7085). Regression 3 in Table I 
shows that the estimated coefficients for GDPGO, SECGO, and 
PRIM60 are not much affected by this change in the dependent 
variable. Thus, measurement errors (or business-cycle effects) can 
be important for the results only if they persist in substantial 
magnitude over periods longer than ten years. 
Regression 4 shows that the conclusions do not change greatly 
if GDP70 is added along with GDPGO (with the growth rate from 
1970 to 1985 as the dependent variable). Although the high 
correlation (0.98) between GDPGO and GDP70 implies high stan- 
dard errors, the sum of the two coefficients is close to that for 
GDPGO in regression 3. The estimated relation between per capita 
growth and level of per capita GDP also looks similar if GDP70 is 
entered as a regressor with GDPGO used as an instrument. 
Presumably, measurement error in GDP would be proportion- 
ately more important for the low-income countries. In fact, the 
squared residuals from regression 1of Table I have a correlation of 
-0.23 with GDPGO. Regression 5 shows that the estimated coeffi- 
cient of GDPGO changes little if the sample is restricted to the 54 
countries for which GDPGO exceeds $1,000 per capita. Regression 6 
shows that the results also do not change greatly if the observa- 
tions are weighted by the square root of GDPGO (which is appropri- 
ate if the variance of the error term is proportional to the reciprocal 
of GDPGO). Regression 7 indicates similar findings when the 
weight is the square root of population (where population is 
measured at the midpoint of the sample for each country). This 
standard weighting scheme is appropriate if the variance of the 
error term is proportional to the reciprocal of population.' The 
correlation of the square of the residuals from regression 1with 
population, however, is only -0.12. 
C. Other Measures of Human Capital 
One problem with the previous results is that the 1960 
school-enrollment rates could be proxying for the flow of invest- 
ment in human capital, rather than for the initial stock. The 
8. This weighting scheme would arise if the growth rate of per capita GDP were 
an average of independent values for each person in the population. As many people 
have noted, this view is an uninteresting theory of the error term, because the error 
would likely vanish in the mean of several million independent observations. If the 
error term relates to common aggregate forces or to model specification, then the 
error variance need not be closely related to population.

positive effects of PRIM60 and SEC6O on GR6085 could then 
reflect a favorable situation that shows up in high investment in 
human capital as well as in rapid growth of GDP. That is, the 
causation need not be simply in the direction from a high initial 
stock of human capital to a high subsequent rate of growth of 
output. 
Regression 8 of Table I attempts to assess the direction of 
causation between human capital and economic growth by adding 
the 1950 values of the school-enrollment rates, SEC50 and PRIM50, 
to a regression for GR6085. Given the values of SEC6O and 
PRIMGO, the 1950 values would reflect differences in the stock of 
human capital in 1960. Although the point estimate for SEC50 in 
regression 8 is positive, neither of the 1950 schooling variables are 
statistically significant. Because the estimated coefficients for 
SEC6O and PRIM60 remain significantly positive, the results 
cannot be attributed to the high correlation (0.83 for secondary and 
0.86 for primary) between the enrollment-rate variables for 1950 
and 1960. 
A possible explanation for the results is that the U. N. data for 
1950 are less accurate than those for 1960 and later years. Some 
support for this view comes from regression 9, which includes 
enrollment rates for 1960 and 1970 in a regression for the growth 
rate from 1970 to 1985 (GR7085). For the primary-school vari- 
ables, PRIM60 is significantly positive, whereas PRIM70 is insignif- 
icant. This finding supports the idea that the primary-school 
enrollment rate (for 1960) is proxying for the initial stock of human 
capital (in 1970) rather than for the flow of investment in human 
capital. Neither of the secondary-school variables are separately 
significant in regression 9 because of the high correlation (0.94) 
between SEC6O and SEC70. (The correlation between PRIM60 
and PRIM70 is only 0.84.) 
As an attempt to measure differences in the quality of educa- 
tion across countries, I used data on student-teacher ratios in the 
initial year, 1960. Regression 10 shows that the ratio for primary 
schools (STTEAPRI) has a negative relation (t - value = 1.9) with 
economic growth (GR6085). This finding accords with the idea that 
a higher student-teacher ratio signals lower quality education and 
hence, a lower initial stock of human capital. Student-teacher 
ratios for secondary schools in 1960 were available for only 88 of 
the 98 countries. Regression 11shows that the estimated coeffi- 
cient of this variable (STTEASEC) differs insignificantly from zero. 
Regression 12 uses the human-capital proxy employed by 
Romer [19891-the 
1960 adult literacy rate (LITGO). With the 


--- Page 17 ---
422 
QUARTERLY JOURNAL. OF ECONOMICS 
school-enrollment rates entered, the estimated coefficient of LIT60 
is negative (t- value = 2.0), a result that is difficult to interpret. (If 
the school-enrollment variables are excluded, the coefficient of 
LIT60 is significantly positive.) The literacy rate is attractive in 
that it relates to the stock of human capital rather than to the flow 
of investment. On the other hand, literacy rates appear to be 
measured in an inconsistent way across countries, and are particu- 
larly inaccurate for the less developed countries. The school- 
enrollment rates, although not immune to measurement problems, 
are likely to be more accurate and more consistent cross sectionally. 
Some theories in which the initial values of human capital and 
per capita GDP matter for subsequent growth rates also suggest 
relations with physical investment and fertility. In endogenous- 
growth models, such as Rebelo [I9901 and Barro [1990], per capita 
growth and the investment ratio tend to move together. For 
example, an exogenous improvement in productivity tends to raise 
the growth rate and the investment ratio. In models that include 
human capital, such as Romer [I9901 and Becker, Murphy, and 
Tamura [19901, an increase in the initial stock of human capital 
tends to raise the ratio of physical investment to GDP. 
In growth models with endogenous fertility, such as Barro and 
Becker [I9891 and Becker, Murphy, and Tamura [19901, per capita 
growth and net fertility tend to move inversely. For example, a 
higher initial stock of human capital leads to higher growth and 
lower fertility. The effect on fertility involves an increase in the 
value of parents' time and thereby a rise in the cost of raising 
children. More generally, any change that increases the cost of 
raising children tends to reduce fertility and to increase desired 
saving per person. In effect, people shift from saving in the form of 
children to saving in the form of physical and human capital. The 
increase in desired saving raises the per capita growth rate in 
models of endogenous g r ~ w t h . ~  
Table I1 shows results for fertility. The variable FERT is the 
average of the 1965 and 1985 values of the World Bank's estimate 
9. A shift in the degree of altruism tends to move fertility and desired saving in 
the same direction. Thus, this kind of disturbance generates a positive association 
between fertility and per capita growth. The overall association between fertility 
and growth would be negative if the parameters that govern altruism are stable 
relative to those that determine the costs of having children.

FERT x (1- MORT04)' where MORT04 is the average of the 
1965 and 1985 values of the World Bank's figures on mortality 
rates for children aged zero through four. Thus, FERTNET is the 
per woman number of children who will live beyond the age of four.

tions between FERTNET and GDP6O (- 0.74) and between FERT-

NET and a human-capital proxy (-0.87). (The human-capital 
measure is 3.01 x SEC6O + 1.56 x PRIMGO, based on regression 
15 in Table 11.) In regression 15 the two school-enrollment rates 
have significantly negative coefficients, and the coefficient of 
GDP6O is insignificant. Thus, for a given value of per capita GDP, 
more human capital is associated with lower net fertility, as 
predicted by Becker, Murphy, and Tamura [19901, among others. 
For given human capital, higher per capita GDP (which means 
more physical capital or natural resources) has an insignificant 
relation with net fertility. 
Regression 16 shows that, with no adjustment for child 
mortality, gross fertility (FERT) is positively related to the child 
mortality rate, MORT04. But regression 17 indicates that the 
estimated coefficient of MORT04 is no longer significantly different 
from zero when FERTNET is the dependent variable. That is, the 
adjustment of fertility rates to reflect the fraction of children that

(3.01*SEC60 + 1.56*PRIM60)  
do not survive past the age of four is sufficient to account for most 
of the positive relation between gross fertility and child mortality. 
(From the standpoint of the costs of raising surviving children, one 
would predict, if anything, a negative relation between MORT04 
and FERTNET.) Regression 18 shows that the population growth 
rate (averaged for each country from 1960 to 1985) relates to 
GDP6O and the human capital variables in a way consistent with 
the findings for fertility rates. 
Table I11 contains results for ratios of real physical investment 
to real GDP. Regressions 20 and 21 refer to private investment 
(i Privly), 
and regressions 22 and 23 to the total of private and public 
investment (ily). The figures on ily come from Summers and 
Heston [19881; note that these values reflect variations across 
countries in the ratio of the investment deflator to the GDP 
deflator. Values for iPTiVly 
equal ily less estimates of the ratio of real

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 
public investment to real GDP. (Figures on nominal public invest- 
ment were divided by the Summers and Heston deflators for total 
investment, and were then divided by real GDP; this procedure is 
appropriate if the deflators for total investment are reasonable 
approximations to the deflators for public investment.) Values for 
public investment at the level of consolidated general government 
(but excluding most government enterprises) were found only for 
the 1970-1985 period, and only for 76 countries. Therefore, zPTivlyis 
an average of values from 1970 to 1985 for this limited sample. 
The simple correlations of iPTivlyare 0.42 with GDP6O and 0.64

regression 20 of Table 111, the estimated coefficients of SEC6O and 
PRIM60 are significantly positive, and that on GDPGO is signifi- 
cantly negative. The positive effect of initial human capital on 
physical investment accords with some theoretical results that 
were discussed before. The negative partial association between 
iP"'ly and GDP6O is consistent with the convergence implication of 
the neoclassical growth model. 
Regression 22 shows results for ily. (This variable is measured 
over the period 1960 to 1985, but the main difference from 
regression 20 is the shift from private to total investment, and not 
the change in the averaging interval for the dependent variable.) 
The results for total investment are broadly similar to those for 
private investment, but the estimated coefficient on GDP6O is 
smaller in magnitude. 
The results in Tables 1-111 treat per capita growth, fertility, 
and investment as endogenous variables that are jointly deter-

mined by the right-hand-side variables (although the exogeneity of 
some of the explanatory variables can surely be questioned). The 
theories of endogenous growth and fertility that were discussed 
before predict that the residuals from the equations for GR6085 
and ily (or GR6085 and iP""ly) would be positively correlated, 
whereas those for GR6085 and FERTNET would be negatively 
correlated (however, see footnote 9). The results shown in Tables 
1-111 accord with this pattern. For example, using regression 1for 
GR6085, regression 22 for ily, and regression 15 for FERTNET, 
the correlation of residuals is 0.32 between GR6085 and ily and 
-0.26 between GR6085 and FERTNET. Using regression 20 for 
iPTiVly,
the correlation of the residuals for GR6085 and i P"vly (for 76 
countries) is 0.40. 
Another way to bring out these patterns is to consider 
regressions for per capita growth in which an investment ratio and

net fertility are included as regressors. Regression 24 of Table IV 
shows that the estimated coefficient of ily is significantly positive: 
0.068, s.e. = 0.032. With FERTNET added in regression 25, the 
estimated coefficient of ily is still significantly positive, and that for 
FERTNET is significantly negative: -0.0043, s.e. = 0.0014. 
Even with ily and PERTNET held constant, the coefficient of 
GDP6O in regression 25 (-0.0077, s.e. = 0.0009) is about the same 


--- Page 25 ---

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 
as that in regression 1of Table I. Therefore, the negative effect of 
the level of per capita GDP on the subsequent growth rate does not 
work very much through effects on investment and net fertility 
(see regressions 22 and 15). The main channel appears to be a lower 
rate of return on investment. On the other hand, the estimated 
coefficients on the school-enrollment variables in regression 25 are 
much smaller than those in regression 1.Thus, the positive effects 
of the school-enrollment rates on GR6085 in regression 1reflect 
partly the positive relation between school enrollment and ily 
(regression 22 in Table 111) and the negative relation between 
school enrollment and FERTNET (regression 15 in Table 11). 
A. Government Expenditures 
In previous analyses [Barro, 1989,19901 I found that the ratio 
of real government consumption expenditure to real GDP (gcly) 
had a negative association with growth and investment. The 
argument was that government consumption had no direct effect 
on private productivity (or private property rights), but lowered 
saving and growth through the distorting effects from taxation or 
government-expenditure programs. Government consumption is 
measured by the Summers and Heston 119881 figures on the ratio 
of real government consumption purchases to real GDP, less 
estimates of the ratio of nominal government spending on educa- 
tion and defense to nominal GDP. The idea is that expenditures on 
education and defense are more like public investment than public 
consumption; in particular, these expenditures are likely to affect 
private-sector productivity or property rights, which matter for 
private investment. I used nominal ratios for education and 
defense because deflators were unavailable. Because the numbers 
on education and defense are averages for 1970-1985, the data on 
gcly are averages over this period. 
The results in Table I indicate a significantly negative associa- 
tion between gcly and growth; for example, in regression 1 the 
estimated coefficient is -0.12, s.e. = 0.03.1° Figure IX shows the 
10. If entered separately, the ratios to GDP of government expenditures on 
education and defense are each insignificant in an equation for per capita growth. 
These types of results were discussed in Barro [1989].

Partial Association Between per Capita Growth and gc/y
(from regression 1of Table I) 
nature of this relationship: the variable on the vertical axis is the 
per capita growth rate net of the fitted value obtained from all 
regressors other than gcly. Table I11 shows that gcly also has a 
negative association with private investment; the estimated coeffi- 
cient in regression 20 is -0.24, s.e. = 0.12. Regression 22 shows, 
however, that the relation with total investment is insignificant 
(-0.02, s.e. = 0.11). 
A negative effect of gcly on investment is one route whereby 
more government could reduce growth. Even with the investment 
ratio held constant, however, the relation between gcly and growth 
is significantly negative. For example, in regression 24 of Table IV, 
which holds constant ily, the estimated coefficient on g7y is -0.12, 
s.e. = 0.03. 
Regression 26 of Table IV includes the public investment ratio 


--- Page 27 ---
432 
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 
gyy as an explanatory variable. The estimated coefficient, 0.13, 
s.e. = 0.10, is positive, but insignificantly different from zero. I 
discussed this variable in my earlier empirical study [Barro, 19891 
and mentioned some difficulties in interpreting the estimated 
coefficient in terms of the marginal product of public services. In 
any event, regression 27 shows that public investment plays no 
special role if the total investment ratio ily (for 1970-1985) is also 
included as a regressor. Given ily, which includes public invest- 
ment one-to-one with private investment, the estimated coefficient 
on gily is essentially zero. Similarly, regression 28 shows that the 
estimated coefficient of the ratio of public to total investment, gili, 
differs insignificantly from zero. 
B. Political Instability 
I included two variables from Banks's [I9791 data set to 
measure political instability. The variable REV is the number of 
revolutions and coups per year, and the variable ASSASS is the 
number per million population of political assassinations per year. 
Each of these variables is significantly negative for growth in Table 
I. The variable REV is also significantly negative for the invest- 
ment ratios in Table 111, and ASSASS is significantly negative in 
regression 20 of that table." 
I interpret the REV and ASSASS variables as adverse influ- 
ences on property rights, and thereby as negative influences on 
investment and growth. Regression 25 of Table IV shows, however, 
that the coefficients on REV and ASSASS are still negative for 
growth when ily and FERTNET are held constant. It is possible 
that these results reflect a positive influence of growth on political 
stability, rather than (or in addition to) the effects of stability on 
growth. Londregan and Poole [I9891 do, in fact, attach this reverse 
interpretation to the negative association that they find between 
economic growth and the frequency of coups. 
C. Economic System 
Gastil [I9871 divided countries into economic systems with 
respect to the role of government. I used this breakdown to 
11. With these political instability variables and the school-enrollment rates 
included, Gastil's [I9871 ordinal indices of political rights or civil liberties are 
insignificant for growth, fertility, or investment. My earlier study [Barro, 19891 
included the index of political stability as an explanatory variable. 


--- Page 28 ---
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A CROSS SECTION OF COUNTRIES 433 
construct a three-way division into primarily socialist, mixed 
between socialist and free enterprise, and primarily free enterprise. 
The estimated coefficient on the dummy variable for socialist 
(SOC) is negative on growth in regression 13 of Table I (t- 
value = 1.81, and that for mixed systems (MIXED) is essentially 
zero. Because the division of economic systems into groups is 
subjective and because there are only nine "socialist" countries in 
the sample (which excludes the eastern European countries), these 
results are not very reliable. 
D. Market Distortions 
It is often argued that distortions of market prices impact 
negatively on economic growth (see, for example, Agarwala [19831). 
Because of the intimate connection between investment and 
growth, such market interferences would be especially important if 
they apply to capital goods. As an attempt to quantify these types of 
market distortions for a large sample of countries, I considered the 
purchasing-power-parity (PPP) numbers for investment goods 
that were computed by Summers and Heston [19881. 
It is well-known (for example, from Balassa [1964]) that PPP 
ratios calculated with broad price indices, such as GDP deflators or 
consumer price indices, are systematically related to the level of 
economic development and perhaps to the presence of natural 
resources and other variables. Figure X shows the significantly 
positive relation for the 98 countries between the 1960 PPP ratio 
based on the GDP deflator (PPPYGO) and GDPGO. This relation 
presumably reflects the relatively low prices of services and some 
other nontraded goods in low-income countries. On the other hand, 
Figure XI indicates the absence of a regular relationship between 
the 1960 PPP ratio based on the investment deflator (PPPIGO) and 
GDPGO. To proxy for market distortions, I would have filtered out 
the normal relation of PPPIGO to variables such as the level of 
income. But, given the absence of a systematic relation in Figure 
XI, I calculated just the magnitude of the deviation of PPPIGO from 
the sample mean. In this view, either artificially high investment 
prices or artificially low investment prices proxy for distortions. 
The regressions in Table I indicate a significantly negative 
relation between growth and the magnitude of the PPPIGO devia- 
tion (denoted PPIGODEV); the estimated coefficient in regression 1 
is -0.014, s.e. = 0.005. This result implies that a one-standard- 
error (0.25) increase in the magnitude of PPPIGO is associated with 


--- Page 29 ---

FIGURE X  
1960 PPP Ratio for GDP Deflator (U. S.= 1.0) Versus 1960 GDP per Capita  
a reduction in the per capita growth rate by four tenths of a 
percentage point. On the other hand, the sign of the deviation does 
not seem to matter; if the algebraic value for purchasing-power 
parity, PPPIGO, is added to the equation, its estimated coefficient is 
insignificant (-0.001, s.e. = 0.005), and that on PPIGODEV re- 
mains significant (-0.014, s.e. = 0.007). Not surprisingly, the 
results in Table I11 indicate that the algebraic value, PPPIGO, 
matters negatively for the investment ratios. (This relationship 
could be induced, however, from measurement error in the invest- 
ment price deflators.) 
These results on the relation of growth and investment to 
market distortions are preliminary. I plan to look further into 
alternative measures of price distortions, including the indices of 
effective protection in manufacturing and agriculture that Agar-
wala [I9831 compiled for a limited sample of countries.

E. Africa and Latin America 
A common view is that countries in Africa or Latin America 
have poorer growth performances than other countries. Of course, 
if the nature of being in Africa or Latin America is already held 
constant by the other explanatory variables, continent dummies 
would be insignificant in equations for growth, fertility, and 
investment. Thus, the finding of significant coefficients on these 
dummies indicates that some regularities are missing from the 
model. 
The dummy variable AFRICA equals one for countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa, and the dummy variable LAT.AMER. equals 
one for countries in South and Central America, including Mexico. 
The estimated coefficient on AFRICA is significantly negative for 
GR6085 (Table I, regression 14) and significantly positive for 
FERTNET (Table 11, regression 19). Although the point estimates 


--- Page 31 ---
436 
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 
are positive, the estimated coefficients for the investment ratios 
differ insignificantly from zero (Table 111, regressions 21 and 23). 
Holding fixed ily and FERTNET in regression 29 of Table IV, the 
estimated coefficient of AFRICA in a growth equation is still 
significantly negative, with a magnitude of about one percentage 
point per year. Thus, there appear to be adverse effects on growth 
from being in sub-Saharan Africa, and these effects do not result 
from the unexplained behavior of the investment ratio or fertility. 
The variable LATAMER. is significantly negative for GR6085 
(Table I, regression 14) and significantly positive for FERTNET 
(Table 11, regression 19). For the investment ratios the point 
estimates of the coefficients are negative, but not statistically 
significant at the 5 percent level (t-value of 1.3 for iPri'ly 
in 
regression 21 of Table I11 and t-value of 1.6 for ily in regression 23). 
Again, the negative effect on growth-with 
a magnitude of about 
one percentage point per year-appears 
even when ily and FERT- 
NET are held constant (Table IV, regression 29). Thus, it appears 
that something is also missing to explain the typically weak growth 
performance in Latin America. 
Note from a comparison of regressions 1and 14 of Table I that 
one effect from the inclusion of the AFRICA and LAT.AMER. 
dummies is a reduction in the estimated coefficient of SEC6O in the 
equation for GR6085 from 0.0305, s.e. = 0.0079, to 0.0133, s.e. = 
0.0070 (see also regressions 25 and 29 in Table IV). The average 
value of SEC6O for sub-Saharan Africa is well below the sample 
mean (0.04 versus 0.23); whereas that for Latin America (0.19) is 
slightly below the sample mean.'' The variables SEC6O and 
PRIM60 are imperfect proxies for the level of human capital, which 
is especially low in Africa. But, since these proxies are imperfect, it 
may be that continent dummies-especially 
the one for Africa- 
retain some explanatory power for human capital and hence for the 
rate of economic growth. If this interpretation is correct, a better 
proxy for human capital would eliminate the AFRICA dummy as a 
significant influence on growth. However, the variables considered 
before-student-teacher 
ratios, prior values of school-enrollment 
rates, and the adult literacy rate--do not eliminate AFRICA as a 
significant variable. 
12. For PRIMGO, the means are 0.50 for Africa, 0.85 for Latin America, and 
0.78 for the overall sample.

ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A CROSS SECTION OF COUNTRIES 437 
Using recent theories of economic growth as a guide, this study 
brings out some empirical regularities about growth, fertility, and 
investment for 98 countries in the period 1960-1985. Although the 
simple correlation between per capita growth (1960-1985) and the 
initial (1960) level of per capita GDP is close to zero, the correlation 
becomes substantially negative if measures of initial human capital 
(proxied by school-enrollment rates) are held constant. Moreover, 
given the level of initial per capita GDP, the growth rate is 
substantially positively related to the starting amount of human 
capital. Thus, poor countries tend to catch up with rich countries if 
the poor countries have high human capital per person (in relation 
to their level of per capita GDP), but not otherwise. As a related 
matter, countries with high human capital have low fertility rates 
and high ratios of physical investment to GDP. 
Per capita growth and the ratio of private investment to GDP 
are negatively related to the ratio of government consumption 
expenditure to GDP. An interpretation is that government con- 
sumption introduces distortions, such as high tax rates, but does 
not provide an offsetting stimulus to investment and growth. On 
the other hand, there is little relation of growth to the quantity of 
public investment. 
Measures of political instability (proxied by figures on revolu- 
tions, coups, and political assassinations) are inversely related to 
growth and investment. These relations could involve the adverse 
effects of political instability on property rights and the linkage 
between property rights and private investment. The correlation 
could, however, also reflect a political response to bad economic 
outcomes. 
A proxy for price distortions (based on purchasing-power 
parity numbers for investment deflators) is negatively related to 
growth. These results are preliminary but do suggest a payoff to 
further research on the interplay between economic growth and 
government-induced distortions of markets. 
Finally, the results leave unexplained a good deal of the 
relatively weak growth performances of countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa and Latin America. That is, the analysis does not fully 
capture the characteristics of the typical country on these conti- 
nents that lead to below-average economic growth.
