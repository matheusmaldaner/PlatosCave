Summary. This article presents a survey of the analysis of cointegration using the
vector autoregressive model. After a few illustrative economic examples, the three
model based approaches to the analysis of cointegration are discussed. The vector
autoregressive model is deﬁned and the moving average representation of the solu-
tion, the Granger representation, is given. Next the interpretation of the model and
its parameters and likelihood based inference follows using reduced rank regression.
The asymptotic analysis includes the distribution of the Gaussian maximum likeli-
hood estimators, the rank test, and test for hypotheses on the cointegrating vectors.
Finally, some applications and extensions of the basic model are mentioned and the
survey concludes with some open problems.
1 Introduction
Granger [13] coined the term cointegration as a formulation of the phenom-
enon that nonstationary processes can have linear combinations that are sta-
tionary. It was his investigations of the relation between cointegration and
error correction that brought modeling of vector autoregressions with unit
roots and cointegration to the center of attention in applied and theoretical
econometrics; see Engle and Granger [10].
During the last 20 years, many have contributed to the development of
theory and applications of cointegration. The account given here focuses on
theory, more precisely on likelihood based theory for the vector autoregressive
model and its extensions; see [21]. By building a statistical model as a frame-
work for inference, one has to make explicit assumptions about the model
used and hence has a possibility of checking the assumptions made.
1.1 Two examples of cointegration
As a ﬁrst simple economic example of the main idea in cointegration, consider
the exchange rate series, et, between Australian and US dollars and four time

in Australia and US. If the quarterly series from 1972:1 to 1991:1 are plotted,
they clearly show nonstationary behavior, and we discuss in the following a
method of modeling such nonstationary time series. As a simple example of an
economic hypothesis consider Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which asserts
that et = pus
t −pau
t . This identity is not found in the data, so a more realistic
formulation is that pppt = et −pus
t
+ pau
t
is a stationary process, possibly
with mean zero. Thus we formulate the economic relation, as expressed by
PPP, as a stationary relation among nonstationary processes. The purpose
of modeling could be to test the null hypothesis that pppt is stationary, or
in other words that (et, pus
t , pau
t iau
t , ius
t ) cointegrate with (1, −1, 1, 0, 0)0 as a
cointegration vector. If that is not found, an outcome could be to suggest
other cointegration relations, which have a better chance of capturing co-
movements of the ﬁve processes in the information set. For a discussion of the
ﬁnding that real exchange rate, pppt, and the spread, iau
t −ius
t , are cointegrated
I(1) processes so that a linear combination pppt −c (iau
t
−ius
t ) is stationary,
see Juselius and MacDonald [31].
Another example is one of the ﬁrst applications of the idea of cointegration
in ﬁnance; see Campbell and Shiller [8]. They considered a present value model
for the price of a stock Yt at the end of period t and the dividend yt paid during
period t. They assume that there is a vector autoregressive model describing
the data which contain Yt and yt and may contain values of other ﬁnancial
assets. The expectations hypothesis is expressed as
Yt = θ(1 −δ)
∞
X
i=0
δjEtyt+i + c,
where c and θ are positive constants and the discount factor δ is between 0
and 1. The notation Etyt+i means model based conditional expectations of
yt+i given information in the data at the end of period t. By subtracting θyt,
the model is written as
Yt −θyt = θ(1 −δ)
∞
X
i=0
δjEt(yt+i −yt) + c.
It is seen that when the processes yt and Yt are nonstationary and their
diﬀerences stationary, the present value model implies that the right hand
side and hence the left hand side are stationary. Thus there is cointegration
between Yt and yt with a cointegration vector β0 = (1, −θ, 0, . . . , 0); see section
6.1 for a discussion of rational expectations and cointegration.
There are at present three diﬀerent ways of modeling the cointegration
idea in a parametric statistical framework. To illustrate the ideas they are
formulated in the simplest possible case, leaving out deterministic terms.

1.2 Three ways of modeling cointegration
The regression formulation
The multivariate process xt = (x0
1t, x0
2t)0 of dimension p = p1 + p2 is given by
the regression equations
x1t = γ0x2t + u1t,
∆x2t = u2t,
where ut = (u0
1t, u0
2t)0 is a linear invertible process deﬁned by i.i.d. errors εt
with mean zero and ﬁnite variance. The assumptions behind this model imply
that x2t is nonstationary and not cointegrated, and hence the cointegration
rank, p1, is known so that models for diﬀerent ranks are not nested. The ﬁrst
estimation method used in this model is least squares regression, Engle and
Granger [10], which is shown to give a superconsistent estimator by Stock [46].
This estimation method gives rise to residual based tests for cointegration. It
was shown by Phillips and Hansen [42] that a modiﬁcation of the regression
estimator, involving a correction using the long-run variance of the process
ut, would give useful methods for inference for coeﬃcients of cointegration
relations; see also Phillips [41].
The autoregressive formulation
The autoregressive formulation is given by
∆xt = αβ0xt−1 + εt,
where εt are i.i.d. errors with mean zero and ﬁnite variance, and α and β
are p × r matrices of rank r. Under the condition that ∆xt is stationary, the
solution is
xt = C
t
X
i=1
εi +
∞
X
i=0
Ciεt−i + A,
(1)
where C = β⊥(α0
⊥β⊥)−1α0
⊥and β0A = 0. Here β⊥is a full rank p × (p −
r) matrix so that β0β⊥= 0. This formulation allows for modeling of both
the long-run relations, β0x, and the adjustment, or feedback α, towards the
attractor set {x : β0x = 0} deﬁned by the long-run relations. Models for
diﬀerent cointegration ranks are nested and the rank can be analyzed by
likelihood ratio tests. Thus the model allows for a more detailed description
of the data than the regression model. Methods usually applied for the analysis
are derived from the Gaussian likelihood function, which are discussed here;
see also [18, 21], and Ahn and Reinsel [1].

The unobserved component formulation
Let xt be given by
xt = ξη0
t
X
i=1
εi + vt,
where vt is a linear process, typically independent of the process εt, which is
i.i.d. with mean zero and ﬁnite variance.
In this formulation too, hypotheses of diﬀerent ranks are nested. The pa-
rameters are linked to the autoregressive formulation by ξ = β⊥and η = α⊥,
even though the linear process in (1) depends on the random walk part, so the
unobserved components model and the autoregressive model are not the same.
Thus both adjustment and cointegration can be discussed in this formulation,
and hypotheses on the rank can be tested. Rather than testing for unit roots
one tests for stationarity, which is sometimes a more natural formulation. Es-
timation is usually performed by the Kalman ﬁlter, and asymptotic theory of
the rank tests has been worked out by Nyblom and Harvey [37].
1.3 The model analyzed in this article
In this article cointegration is modelled by the vector autoregressive model
for the p−dimensional process xt
∆xt = α (β0xt−1 + ΥDt) +
k−1
X
i=1
Γi ∆xt−i + Φdt + εt,
(2)
where εt are i.i.d. with mean zero and variance Ω, and Dt and dt are deter-
ministic terms, like constant, trend, seasonal- or intervention dummies. The
matrices α and β are p × r where 0 ≤r ≤p. The parametrization of the
deterministic term αΥDt + Φdt, is discussed in section 2.2. Under suitable
conditions, see again section 2.2, the processes β0xt and ∆xt are stationary
around their means, and (2) can be formulated as
∆xt −E(∆xt) = α (β0xt−1 −E(β0xt−1)) +
k−1
X
i=1
Γi (∆xt−i −E(∆xt−i)) + εt.
This shows how the change of the process reacts to feedback from disequi-
librium errors β0xt−1 −E(β0xt−1) and ∆xt−i −E(∆xt−i), via the short-run
adjustment coeﬃcients α and Γi. The equation β0xt −E(β0xt) = 0 deﬁnes the
long-run relations between the processes.
There are many surveys of the theory of cointegration; see for instance
Watson [48] or Johansen [26]. The topic has become part of most textbooks
in econometrics; see among others Banerjee, Dolado, Galbraith and Hendry
[4], Hamilton [14], Hendry [17] and Lütkepohl [34]. For a general account of
the methodology of the cointegrated vector autoregressive model, see Juselius
[32].

2 Integration, cointegration and Granger’s
Representation Theorem
The basic deﬁnitions of integration and cointegration are given together with
a moving average representation of the solution of the error correction model
(2). This solution reveals the stochastic properties of the solution. Finally the
interpretation of cointegration relations is discussed.
2.1 Deﬁnition of integration and cointegration
The vector autoregressive model for the p−dimensional process xt given by (2)
is a dynamic stochastic model for all components of xt. By recursive substitu-
tion, the equations deﬁne xt as function of initial values, x0, . . . , x−k+1, errors
ε1, . . . , εt, deterministic terms, and parameters. Properties of the solution of
these equations are studied through the characteristic polynomial
Ψ(z) = (1 −z)Ip −Πz −(1 −z)
k−1
X
i=1
Γizi
(3)
with determinant |Ψ(z)|. The function C(z) = Ψ(z)−1 has poles at the roots of
the polynomial |Ψ(z)| and the position of the poles determines the stochastic
properties of the solution of (2). First a well known result is mentioned; see
Anderson [3].
Theorem 1. If |Ψ(z)| = 0 implies that |z| > 1, then α and β have full rank p,
and the coeﬃcients of Ψ−1(z) = P∞
i=0 Cizi are exponentially decreasing. Let
μt = P∞
i=0 Ci(αΥDt−i + Φdt−i). Then the distribution of the initial values of
xt can be chosen so that xt −μt is stationary. Moreover, xt has the moving
average representation
xt =
∞
X
i=0
Ciεt−i + μt.
(4)
Thus the exponentially decreasing coeﬃcients are found by simply invert-
ing the characteristic polynomial if the roots are outside the unit disk. If
this condition fails, the equations generate nonstationary processes of various
types, and the coeﬃcients are not exponentially decreasing. Still, the coeﬃ-
cients of C(z) determine the stochastic properties of the solution of (2), as
is discussed in section 2.2. A process of the form (4) is a linear process and
forms the basis for the deﬁnitions of integration and cointegration.
Deﬁnition 1. The process xt is integrated of order 1, I(1), if ∆xt −E(∆xt)
is a linear process, with C(1) = P∞
i=0 Ci 6= 0. If there is a vector β 6= 0 so
that β0xt is stationary around its mean, then xt is cointegrated with cointe-
gration vector β. The number of linearly independent cointegration vectors is
the cointegration rank.

Example 1. A bivariate process is given for t = 1, . . . , T by the equations
∆x1t = α1(x1t−1 −x2t−1) + ε1t,
∆x2t = α2(x1t−1 −x2t−1) + ε2t.
Subtracting the equations, we ﬁnd that the process yt = x1t −x2t is autore-
gressive and stationary if |1+α1 −α2| < 1 and the initial value is given by its
invariant distribution. Similarly we ﬁnd that St = α2x1t −α1x2t is a random
walk, so that

=

yt.
This shows, that when |1 + α1 −α2| < 1, xt is I(1), x1t −x2t is stationary,
and α2x1t −α1x2t is a random walk, so that xt is a cointegrated I(1) process
with cointegration vector β0 = (1, −1). We call St a common stochastic trend
and α the adjustment coeﬃcients.
Example 1 presents a special case of the Granger Representation Theorem,
which gives the moving average representation of the solution of the error
correction model.
2.2 The Granger Representation Theorem
If the characteristic polynomial Ψ(z) deﬁned in (3) has a unit root, then
Ψ(1) = −Π is singular, of rank r < p, and the process is not stationary. Next
the I(1) condition is formulated. It guarantees that the solution of (2) is a
cointegrated I(1) process. Let Γ = Ip−Pk−1
i=1 Γi and denote for a p×m matrix
a by a⊥a p × (p −m) matrix of rank p −m.
Condition 1. (The I(1) condition) The I(1)condition is satisﬁed if |Ψ(z)| = 0
implies that |z| > 1 or z = 1 and that
|α0
⊥Γβ⊥| 6= 0.
(5)
Condition (5) is needed to avoid solutions that are integrated of order 2
or higher; see section 6. For a process with one lag Γ = Ip and
β0xt = (Ir + β0α)β0xt−1 + β0εt.
In this case the I(1) condition is equivalent to the condition that the absolute
value of the eigenvalues of Ir +β0α are bounded by one, and in example 1 the
condition is |1 + α1 −α2| < 1.
Theorem 2. (The Granger Representation Theorem) Let Ψ(z) be deﬁned by
(3). If Ψ(z) has unit roots and the I(1) condition is satisﬁed, then

i (εt−i + Φdt−i + αΥDt−i) + A,
(8)
where A depends on initial values, so that β0A = 0.
This result implies that ∆xt and β0xt are stationary, so that xt is a cointe-
grated I(1) process with r cointegration vectors β and p−r common stochastic
trends α0
⊥
Pt
i=1 εi. The interpretation of this is that among p nonstationary
processes the model (2) generates r stationary or stable relations and p −r
stochastic trends or driving trends, which create the nonstationarity.
The result (6) rests on the observation that the singularity of Ψ(z) for z = 1
implies that Ψ(z)−1 has a pole at z = 1. Condition (5) is a condition for this
pole to be of order one. This is not proved here, see [27], but it is shown how
this result can be applied to prove the representation result (8), which shows
how coeﬃcients of the inverse polynomial determine the properties of xt.
We multiply Ψ(L)xt = Φdt + αΥDt + εt by
(1 −L)Ψ(L)−1 = C(L) = C + (1 −L)C∗(L)
and ﬁnd
∆xt = (1 −L)Ψ(L)−1Ψ(L)xt = (C + ∆C∗(L))(εt + αΥDt + Φdt).
Now deﬁne the stationary process zt = C∗(L)εt and the deterministic function
μt = C∗(L)(αΥDt + Φdt), and note that CαΥ = 0, so that
∆xt = C(εt + Φdt) + ∆(zt + μt),
which cumulates to
xt = C
t
X
i=1
(εi + Φdi) + zt + μt + A,
where A = x0 −z0 −μ0. The distribution of x0 is chosen so that β0x0 =
β0(z0 + μ0), and hence β0A = 0. Then xt is I(1) and β0xt = β0zt + β0μt is
stationary around its mean E(β0xt) = β0μt. Finally, ∆xt is stationary around
its mean E(∆xt) = CΦdt + ∆μt.

One of the useful applications of the representation (8) is to investigate
the role of the deterministic terms. Note that dt cumulates in the process
with a coeﬃcient CΦ, but that Dt does not, because CαΥ = 0. A leading
special case is the model with Dt = t, and dt = 1, which ensures that any
linear combination of the components of xt is allowed to have a linear trend.
Note that if Dt = t is not allowed in the model, that is Υ = 0, then xt has a
trend given by CΦt, but the cointegration relation β0xt has no trend because
β0CΦ = 0.
2.3 Interpretation of cointegrating coeﬃcients
Consider ﬁrst a usual regression
x1t = γ2x2t + γ3x3t + εt,
(9)
with i.i.d. errors εt which are independent of the processes x2t and x3t. The
coeﬃcient γ2 is interpreted via a counterfactual experiment, that is, the coef-
ﬁcient γ2 is the eﬀect on x1t of a change in x2t, keeping x3t constant.
The cointegration relations are long-run relations. This means that they
have been there all the time, and they inﬂuence the movement of the process
xt via the adjustment coeﬃcients α. The more the process β0xt deviates from
Eβ0xt, the more the adjustment coeﬃcients pull the process back towards its
mean. Another interpretation is that they are relations that would hold in the
limit, provided all shocks in the model are set to zero after a time t.
It is therefore natural that interpretation of cointegration coeﬃcients in-
volves the notion of a long-run value. From the Granger Representation The-
orem 8 applied to the model with no deterministic terms, it can be proved,
see [25], that
x∞|t = lim
h→∞E(xt+h|xt, . . . , xt−k+1) = C(xt −
k−1
X
i=1
Γixt−i) = C
t
X
i=1
εi + x∞|0.
This limiting conditional expectation is a long-run value of the process.
Because β0x∞|t = 0, the point x∞|t is in the attractor set {x : β0x = 0} =
sp{β⊥}, see Figure 1.
Thus if the current value, xt, is shifted to xt + h, then the long-run value
is shifted from x∞|t to x∞|t + Ch, which is still a point in the attractor set
because β0x∞|t + β0Ch = 0. If a given long-run change k = Cξ in x∞|t is
needed, Γk is added to the current value xt. This gives the long-run value
x∞|t + CΓk = x∞|t + CΓCξ = x∞|t + Cξ = x∞|t + k,
where the identity CΓC = C is applied; see (7). This idea is now used to give
an interpretation of a cointegration coeﬃcient in the simple case of r = 1,
p = 3, and where the relation is normalized on x1

x1 = γ2x2 + γ3x3,
(10)
so that β0 = (1, −γ2, −γ3). In order to give the usual interpretation as a
regression coeﬃcient (or elasticity if the measurements are in logs), a long-
run change with the properties that x2 changes by one, x1 changes by γ2, and
x3 is kept ﬁxed, is needed. Thus the long-run change is k = (γ2, 1, 0), which
satisﬁes β0k = 0, so that k = Cξ for some ξ, and this can be achieved by
moving the current value from xt to xt + CΓk. In this sense, a coeﬃcient in
an identiﬁed cointegration relation can be interpreted as the eﬀect of a long-
run change to one variable on another, keeping all others ﬁxed in the long
run. More details can be found in [25] and Proietti [43].
3 Interpretation of the I(1) model for cointegration
In this section model H(r) deﬁned by (2) is discussed. The parameters in H(r)
are
(α, β, Γ1, . . . , Γk−1, Υ, Φ, Ω) .
All parameters vary freely and α and β are p × r matrices. The normalization
and identiﬁcation of α and β are discussed, and some examples of hypotheses
on α and β, which are of economic interest are given.
3.1 The models H(r)
The models H(r) are nested


--- Page 10 ---

Søren Johansen
H(0) ⊂· · · ⊂H(r) ⊂· · · ⊂H(p).
Here H(p) is the unrestricted vector autoregressive model, so that α and β are
unrestricted p×p matrices. The model H(0) corresponds to the restriction α =
β = 0, which is the vector autoregressive model for the process in diﬀerences.
Note that in order to have nested models, we allow in H(r) for all processes
with rank less than or equal to r.
The formulation allows us to derive likelihood ratio tests for the hypothesis
H(r) in the unrestricted model H(p). These tests can be applied to check if
one’s prior knowledge of the number of cointegration relations is consistent
with the data, or alternatively to construct an estimator of the cointegration
rank.
Note that when the cointegration rank is r, the number of common trends
is p−r. Thus if one can interpret the presence of r cointegration relations one
should also interpret the presence of p −r independent stochastic trends or
p −r driving forces in the data.
3.2 Normalization of parameters of the I(1) model
The parameters α and β in (2) are not uniquely identiﬁed, because given any
choice of α and β and any nonsingular r×r matrix ξ, the choice αξ and βξ0−1
gives the same matrix Π = αβ0 = αξ(βξ0−1)0.
If xt = (x0
1t, x0
2t)0 and β = (β0
1, β0
2)0, with |β1| 6= 0, we can solve the
cointegration relations as
x1t = γ0x2t + ut,
where ut is stationary and γ0 = −(β0
1)−1β0
2. This represents cointegration as
a regression equation. A normalization of this type is sometimes convenient
for estimation and calculation of ‘standard errors’ of the estimate, see section
5.2, but many hypotheses are invariant with respect to a normalization of β,
and thus, in a discussion of a test of such a hypothesis, β does not require
normalization. As seen in subsection 3.3, many stable economic relations are
expressed in terms of identifying restrictions, for which the regression formu-
lation is not convenient.
From the Granger Representation Theorem we see that the p −r common
trends are the nonstationary random walks in C Pt
i=1 εi, that is, can be chosen
as α0
⊥
Pt
i=1 εi. For any full rank (p −r)×(p −r) matrix η, ηα0
⊥
Pt
i=1 εi could
also be used as common trends because
C

⊥
t
X
i=1
εi) = β⊥(ηα0
⊥Γβ⊥)−1(ηα0

εi).
Thus identifying restrictions on the coeﬃcients in α⊥are needed to ﬁnd their
estimates and standard errors.
In the cointegration model there are therefore three diﬀerent identiﬁcation
problems: one for the cointegration relations, one for the common trends, and
ﬁnally one for the short run dynamics, if the model has simultaneous eﬀects.

3.3 Hypotheses on long-run coeﬃcients
The purpose of modeling economic data is to test hypotheses on the coeﬃ-
cients, thereby investigating whether the data supports an economic hypoth-
esis or rejects it. In the example with the series xt = (pau
t , pus
t , iau
t , ius
t , et)0
the hypothesis of PPP is formulated as the hypothesis that (1, −1, 1, 0, 0)
is a cointegration relation. Similarly, the hypothesis of price homogeneity is
formulated as
R0β = (1, 1, 0, 0, 0)β = 0,
or equivalently as β = R⊥ϕ = Hϕ, for some vector ϕ and H = R⊥. The hy-
pothesis that the interest rates are stationary is formulated as the hypothesis
that the two vectors (0, 0, 0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) are cointegration vectors. A
general formulation of restrictions on each of r cointegration vectors, including
a normalization, is
β = (h1 + H1ϕ1, . . . , hr + Hrϕr) .
(11)
Here hi is p × 1 and orthogonal to Hi which is p × (si −1) of rank si −1, so
that p −si restrictions are imposed on the vector βi. Let Ri = (hi, Hi)⊥then
βi satisﬁes the restrictions R0
iβi = 0, and the normalization (h0
ihi)−1h0
iβi = 1.
Wald’s identiﬁcation criterion is that βi is identiﬁed if
R0
i(β1, . . . , βr) = r −1.
3.4 Hypotheses on adjustment coeﬃcients
The coeﬃcients in α measure how the process adjusts to disequilibrium errors.
The hypothesis of weak exogeneity is the hypothesis that some rows of α are
zero; see Engle, Hendry and Richard [11]. The process xt is decomposed as
xt = (x0
1t, x0
2t)0 and the matrices are decomposed similarly so that the model
equations without deterministic terms become
∆x1t = α1β0xt−1 + Pk−1
i=1 Γ1i∆xt−i + ε1t,
∆x2t = α2β0xt−1 + Pk−1
i=1 Γ2i∆xt−i + ε2t.
If α2 = 0, there is no levels feedback from β0xt−1 to ∆x2t, and if the errors
are Gaussian, x2t is weakly exogenous for α1, β. The conditional model for
∆x1t given ∆x2t and the past is
∆x1t = ω∆x2t + α1β0xt−1 +
k−1
X
i=1
(Γ1i −ωΓ2i)∆xt−i + ε1t −ωε2t,
(12)
where ω = Ω12Ω−1
22 . Thus full maximum likelihood inference on α1 and β can
be conducted in the conditional model (12).
An interpretation of the hypothesis of weak exogeneity is the following:
if α2 = 0 then α⊥contains the columns of (0, Ip−r)0, so that Pt
i=1 ε2i are
common trends. Thus the errors in the equations for x2t cumulate in the
system and give rise to nonstationarity.

4 Likelihood analysis of the I(1) model
This section contains ﬁrst some comments on what aspects are important
for checking for model misspeciﬁcation, and then describes the calculation
of reduced rank regression, introduced by Anderson [2]. Then reduced rank
regression and modiﬁcations thereof are applied to estimate the parameters
of the I(1) model (2) and various submodels.
4.1 Checking the speciﬁcations of the model
In order to apply Gaussian maximum likelihood methods, the assumptions
behind the model have to be checked carefully, so that one is convinced that
the statistical model contains the density that describes the data. If this is
not the case, the asymptotic results available from the Gaussian analysis need
not hold. Methods for checking vector autoregressive models include choice
of lag length, test for normality of residuals, tests for autocorrelation, and
test for heteroscedasticity in errors. Asymptotic results for estimators and
tests derived from the Gaussian likelihood turn out to be robust to some
types of deviations from the above assumptions. Thus the limit results hold
for i.i.d. errors with ﬁnite variance, and not just for Gaussian errors, but
autocorrelated errors violate the asymptotic results, so autocorrelation has to
be checked carefully.
Finally and perhaps most importantly, the assumption of constant para-
meters is crucial. In practice it is important to model outliers by suitable
dummies, but it is also important to model breaks in the dynamics, breaks
in the cointegration properties, breaks in the stationarity properties, etc. The
papers by Seo [45] and Hansen and Johansen [16] contain some results on
recursive tests in the cointegration model.
4.2 Reduced rank regression
Let ut, wt, and zt be three multivariate time series of dimensions pu, pw, and
pz respectively. The algorithm of reduced rank regression, see Anderson [2],
can be described in the regression model
ut = αβ0wt + Γzt + εt,
(13)
where εt are the errors with variance Ω. The product moments are
Suw = T −1

and the residuals, which we get by regressing ut on wt, are

so that the conditional product moments are

Let Π = αβ0. The unrestricted regression estimates are
ˆΠ = Suw.zS−1
ww.z, ˆΓ = Suz.wS−1
zz.w, and ˆΩ= Suu.w,z.
Reduced rank regression of ut on wt corrected for zt gives estimates of α, β
and Ωin (13). First the eigenvalue problem
|λSww.z −Swu.zS−1
uu.zSuw.z| = 0
(14)
is solved. The eigenvalues are ordered ˆλ1 ≥· · · ≥ˆλpw, with corresponding
eigenvectors ˆv1, . . . , ˆvpw. The reduced rank estimates of β, α, Γ, and Ωare
given by
ˆβ = (ˆv1, . . . , ˆvr),
ˆα = Suw.zˆβ,
ˆΓ = Suz.ˆβ

(15)
The eigenvectors are orthogonal because ˆv0
iSww.zˆvj = 0 for i 6= j, and are
normalized by ˆv0
iSww.zˆvi = 1. The calculations described here are called a
reduced rank regression and are denoted by RRR(ut, wt|zt).
4.3 Maximum likelihood estimation in the I(1) model and
derivation of the rank test
Consider the I(1) model given by equation (2). Note that the multiplier αΥ
of Dt is restricted to be proportional to α so that, by the Granger Represen-
tation Theorem, Dt does not cumulate in the process. It is assumed for the
derivations of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio tests that
εt is i.i.d. Np(0, Ω), but for asymptotic results the Gaussian assumption is not
needed. The Gaussian likelihood function shows that the maximum likelihood
estimator can be found by the reduced rank regression
RRR(∆xt, (x0
t−1, D0
t)0|∆xt−1, . . . , ∆xt−k+1, dt).
It is convenient to introduce the notation for residuals
R0t = (∆xt|∆xt−1, . . . , ∆xt−k+1, dt)
R1t = ((x0
t−1, D0
t)0|∆xt−1, . . . , ∆xt−k+1, dt)

The estimates are given by (15), and the maximized likelihood is, apart from
a constant, given by

(16)
Note that all the models H(r), r = 0, . . . , p, have been solved by the
same eigenvalue calculation. The maximized likelihood is given for each r
by (16) and by dividing the maximized likelihood function for r with the
corresponding expression for r = p, the likelihood ratio test for cointegration
rank is obtained:
−2logLR(H(r)|H(p)) = −T
p
X
i=r+1
log(1 −ˆλi).
(17)
This statistic was considered by Bartlett [5] for testing canonical correlations.
The asymptotic distribution of this test statistic and the estimators are dis-
cussed in section 5.
The model obtained under the hypothesis β = Hϕ, is analyzed by
RRR(∆xt, (H0x0
t−1, D0
t)0|∆xt−1, . . . , ∆xt−k+1, dt),
and a number of hypotheses of this type for β and α can be solved in the
same way, but the more general hypothesis
β = (h1 + H1ϕ1, . . . , hr + Hrϕr) ,
cannot be solved by reduced rank regression. With α = (α1, . . . , αr) and
Υ = (Υ 0
1, . . . , Υ 0
r)0, equation (2) becomes
∆xt =
r
X
j=1
αj((hj + Hjϕj)0xt−1 + ΥjDt) +
k−1
X
i=1
Γi∆xt−i + Φdt + εt.
This is reduced rank regression, but there are r reduced rank matrices
αj(1, ϕ0
j, Υj) of rank one. The solution is not given by an eigenvalue problem,
but there is a simple modiﬁcation of the reduced rank algorithm, which is
easy to implement and is quite often found to converge. The algorithm has
the property that the likelihood function is maximized in each step. The algo-
rithm switches between reduced rank regressions of ∆xt on (x0
t−1(Hi, hi), D0
t)0
corrected for
(((hj + Hjϕj)0xt−1 + ΥjDt)j6=i, ∆xt−1, . . . , ∆xt−k+1, dt).
This result can immediately be applied to calculate likelihood ratio tests
for many diﬀerent restrictions on the coeﬃcients of the cointegration relations.
Thus, in particular, this can give a test of over-identifying restrictions.

5 Asymptotic analysis
A discussion of the most important aspects of the asymptotic analysis of
the cointegration model is given. This includes the result that the rank test
requires a family of Dickey-Fuller type distributions, depending on the speci-
ﬁcation of the deterministic terms of the model. The asymptotic distribution
of ˆβ is mixed Gaussian and that of the remaining parameters is Gaussian, so
that tests for hypotheses on the parameters are asymptotically distributed as
χ2. All results are taken from Johansen [21]
5.1 Asymptotic distribution of the rank test
The asymptotic distribution of the rank test is given in case the process has
a linear trend.
Theorem 3. Let εt be i.i.d. (0, Ω) and assume that Dt = t and dt = 1,
in model (2). Under the assumptions that the cointegration rank is r, the
asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic (17) is
−2logLR(H(r)|H(p))
d→tr{
Z 1
0
(dB)F 0(

Z 1

F(dB)0},
(18)
where F is deﬁned by
F(u) =
µ B(u)
u
¯¯¯¯ 1
¶
,
and B(u) is the p −r dimensional standard Brownian motion.
The limit distribution is tabulated by simulating the distribution of the
test of no cointegration in the model for a p −r dimensional model with
one lag and the same deterministic terms. Note that the limit distribution
does not depend on the parameters (Γ1, . . . , Γk−1, Υ, Φ, Ω), but only on p−r,
the number of common trends, and the presence of the linear trend. For ﬁnite
samples, however, the dependence on the parameters can be quite pronounced.
A small sample correction for the test has been given in [24], and the bootstrap
has been investigated by Swensen [47].
In the model without deterministics the same result holds, but with F(u) =
B(u). A special case of this, for p = 1, is the Dickey-Fuller test and the
distributions (18) are called the Dickey—Fuller distributions with p−r degrees
of freedom; see [9].
The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic for rank depends on the
deterministic terms in the model. It follows from the Granger Representa-
tion Theorem that the deterministic term dt is cumulated to CΦ Pt
i=1 di. In
deriving the asymptotics, xt is normalized by T −1/2. If Pt
i=1 di is bounded,
this normalization implies that the limit distribution does not depend on the
precise form of Pt
i=1 di. Thus, if dt is a centered seasonal dummy, or an ‘inno-
vation dummy’ dt = 1{t=t0}, it does not change the asymptotic distribution.


--- Page 16 ---

Søren Johansen
If, on the other hand, a ‘step dummy’ dt = 1{t≥t0} is included, then the cumu-
lation of this is a broken linear trend, and that inﬂuences the limit distribution
and requires special tables; see [29].
5.2 Asymptotic distribution of the estimators
The main result here is that the estimator of β, suitably normalized, converges
to a mixed Gaussian distribution, even when estimated under continuously
diﬀerentiable restrictions [20]. This result implies that likelihood ratio tests
on β are asymptotically χ2 distributed. Furthermore the estimators of the
adjustment parameters α and the short-run parameters Γi are asymptotically
Gaussian and asymptotically independent of the estimator for β.
In order to illustrate these results, the asymptotic distribution of ˆβ for
r = 2 is given, when β is identiﬁed by
β = (h1 + H1ϕ1, h2 + H2ϕ2).

Theorem 4. In model (2) without deterministic terms and εt i.i.d. (0, Ω),
the asymptotic distribution of Tvec(ˆβ −β) is given by

Thus the result (20) states that, given the asymptotic information or equiva-
lently the limit of the common trends, α0
⊥W, the limit distribution of T(ˆβ−β)
is Gaussian with a variance that is a function of the inverse limit information.
Hence the asymptotic distribution of

is a standard Gaussian distribution. Here ¯H0
i = (H0
iHi)−1H0
i. This implies
that Wald and therefore likelihood ratio tests on β can be conducted using
the asymptotic χ2 distribution.
It is therefore possible to scale the deviations ˆβ −β in order to obtain an
asymptotic Gaussian distribution. Note that the scaling matrix J 1/2
T
is not an
estimate of the asymptotic variance of ˆβ, but an estimate of the asymptotic
conditional variance given the information in the data. It is therefore not the
asymptotic distribution of ˆβ that is used for inference, but the conditional
distribution given the information; see Basawa and Scott [6] or [19] for a
discussion. Finally the result on the likelihood ratio test for the restrictions
given in (19) is formulated.
Theorem 5. Let εt be i.i.d. (0, Ω). The asymptotic distribution of the likeli-
hood ratio test statistic for the restrictions (19) in model (2) with no deter-
ministic terms is χ2 with degrees of freedom given by Pr
i=1(p −r −si + 1).
This result is taken from [21], and a small sample correction for some tests
on β has been developed in [23].
6 Further topics in the area of cointegration
It is mentioned here how the I(1) model can be applied to test hypotheses
implied by rational expectations. The basic model for I(1) processes can be
extended to other models of nonstationarity. In particular models for sea-
sonal roots, explosive roots, I(2) processes, fractionally integrated processes
and nonlinear cointegration. We discuss here models for I(2) processes, and
refer to the paper by Lange and Rahbek [33] for some models of nonlinear
cointegration.

6.1 Rational expectations
Many economic models operate with the concept of rational or model based
expectations; see Hansen and Sargent [15]. An example of such a formulation
is uncovered interest parity,
∆eet+1 = i1
t −i2
t,
(22)
which expresses a balance between interest rates in two countries and economic
expectations of exchange rate changes. If a vector autoregressive model
∆xt = αβ0xt−1 + Γ1∆xt−1 + εt,
(23)
ﬁts the data xt = (et, i1
t, i2
t)0, the assumption of model based expectations,
Muth [35], means that ∆eet+1 can be replaced by the conditional expectation
Et∆et+1 based upon model (23). That is,
∆eet+1 = Et∆et+1 = α1β0xt + Γ11∆xt.
Assumption (22) implies the identity
i1
t −i2
t = α1β0xt + Γ11∆xt.
Hence the cointegration relation is
β0xt = i1
t −i2
t,
and the other parameters are restricted by α1 = 1, and Γ11 = 0. Thus,
the hypothesis (22) implies a number of testable restrictions on the vec-
tor autoregressive model. The implications of model based expectations for
the cointegrated vector autoregressive model is explored in [30], where it is
shown that, as in the example above, rational expectation restrictions assume
testable information on cointegration relations and short-run adjustments. It
is demonstrated how estimation under rational expectation restrictions can
be performed by regression and reduced rank regression in certain cases.
6.2 The I(2) model
It is sometimes found that inﬂation rates are best described by I(1) processes
and then log prices are I(2). In such a case α0
⊥Γβ⊥has reduced rank; see (5).
Under this condition model (2) can be parametrized as
∆2xt = α(β0xt−1 + ψ0∆xt−1) + Ωα⊥(α0
⊥Ωα⊥)−1κ0τ 0∆xt−1 + εt,
(24)
where α and β are p × r and τ is p × (r + s), or equivalently as
∆2xt = α

where
δ = ψ0τ⊥, ζ = αψ0¯τ + Ωα⊥(α0
⊥Ωα⊥)−1κ0;
see [22] and Paruolo and Rahbek [39]. Under suitable conditions on the para-
meters, the solution of equations (24) or (25) has the form

where yt is stationary and C1 and C2 are functions of the model parameters.
One can prove that the processes ∆2xt, β0xt + ψ0∆xt, and τ 0∆xt are sta-
tionary. Thus τ 0xt are cointegration relations from I(2) to I(1). The model
also allows for multicointegration, that is, cointegration between levels and
diﬀerences because β0xt + ψ0∆xt is stationary; see Engle and Yoo [12]. Maxi-
mum likelihood estimation can be performed by a switching algorithm using
the two parametrizations given in (24) and (25). The same techniques can be
used for a number of hypotheses on the cointegration parameters β and τ.
The asymptotic theory of likelihood ratio tests and maximum likelihood es-
timators is developed by Johansen [22, 28], Rahbek, Kongsted, and Jørgensen
[44], Paruolo [38, 40], Boswijk [7] and Nielsen and Rahbek [36]. It is shown
that the likelihood ratio test for rank involves not only Brownian motion,
but also integrated Brownian motion and hence some new Dickey-Fuller type
distributions that have to be simulated. The asymptotic distribution of the
maximum likelihood estimator is quite involved, as it is not mixed Gaussian,
but many hypotheses still allow asymptotic χ2 inference; see [28].
7 Concluding remarks
What has been developed for the cointegrated vector autoregressive model is a
set of useful tools for the analysis of macroeconomic and ﬁnancial time series.
The theory is part of many textbooks, and software for the analysis of data
has been implemented in several packages, e.g. in CATS in RATS, Givewin,
Eviews, Microﬁt, Shazam, R, etc.
Many theoretical problems remain unsolved, however. We mention here
three important problems for future development.
1. The analysis of models for time series strongly relies on asymptotic
methods, and it is often a problem to obtain suﬃciently long series in eco-
nomics which actually measure the same variables for the whole period. There-
fore periods which can be modelled by constant parameters are often rather
short, and it is therefore extremely important to develop methods for small
sample correction of the asymptotic results. Such methods can be analytic or
simulation based. When these will become part of the software packages, and
are routinely applied, they will ensure more reliable inference.
2. A very interesting and promising development lies in the analysis of
cointegration in nonlinear time series, where the statistical theory is still in its


--- Page 20 ---

Søren Johansen
beginning. Many diﬀerent types of nonlinearities are possible, and the theory
has to be developed in close contact with applications in order to ensure that
useful models and concepts are developed; see the overview [33].
3. Most importantly, however, is the development of an economic theory
which takes into account the ﬁndings of empirical analyses of nonstationary
economic data. For a long time, regression analysis and correlations have
been standard tools for quantitative analysis of relations between variables
in economics. Economic theory has incorporated these techniques in order to
learn from data. In the same way economic theory should be developed to
incorporate nonstationarity of data and develop theories consistent with the
ﬁndings of empirical cointegration analyses.
