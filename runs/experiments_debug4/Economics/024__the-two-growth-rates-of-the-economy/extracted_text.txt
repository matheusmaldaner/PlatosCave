The Two Growth Rates of the Economy

Abstract
Economic growth is measured as the rate of relative change in gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita. Yet, when incomes follow random multiplicative growth, the ensemble-average (GDP
per capita) growth rate is higher than the time-average growth rate achieved by each individual
in the long run. This mathematical fact is the starting point of ergodicity economics. Using
the atypically high ensemble-average growth rate as the principal growth measure creates an in-
complete picture. Policymaking would be better informed by reporting both ensemble-average
and time-average growth rates. We analyse rigorously these growth rates and describe their
evolution in the United States and France over the last ﬁfty years. The diﬀerence between the
two growth rates gives rise to a natural measure of income inequality, equal to the mean log-
arithmic deviation. Despite being estimated as the average of individual income growth rates,
the time-average growth rate is independent of income mobility.

Introduction
Ergodicity economics is a perspective that emerges when we ask explicitly whether stochastic
processes used as economic models are ergodic (Peters, 2019). If a stochastic process is ergodic, its
ensemble average1 is identical to its time average.2 An important counterexample is multiplicative
growth with random shocks, a widely used model of growth in economics and elsewhere. Here,
the ensemble average grows exponentially at a deterministic rate, which we call the ensemble-
average growth rate. In the long-time limit, any individual trajectory also grows exponentially at
a deterministic rate, which we label the time-average growth rate. Crucially, these two rates diﬀer:
the ensemble-average growth rate is greater than the time-average growth rate.
In this paper we explore what ergodicity economics tells us about measures of national economic
performance.
We ﬁnd that the two growth rates described above correspond to two types of
economic growth that are discussed in various guises in the literature.
The ensemble-average growth rate is closely related to the most quoted measure of national eco-
nomic performance, namely to the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. GDP
is the total income generated by the economic activity of a national population, so the growth rate
of GDP per capita is simply the growth rate of average income. For large populations, this coincides
with the ensemble-average growth rate. The GDP per capita growth rate is a so-called plutocratic
growth measure in the following sense: it is approximately a weighted average of individual income
growth rates, where the weight assigned to each individual is proportional to their income.3
The time-average growth rate is representative of individual growth, being the growth rate realised
with certainty by each income in the long-time limit. Unlike the ensemble-average growth rate, it
is rarely measured or stated. The time-average growth rate can be estimated as the average of the
individual income growth rates. This makes it a democratic growth measure, because each person
is assigned an equal weight in the average. To keep the symmetry between ensemble averages and
time averages, and to provide a handy nomenclature, we introduce the democratic domestic product
(DDP) per capita as the quantity that grows at the time-average growth rate.4
The ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate may measure changes in a nation’s total pro-
ductive capacity, but it is an unsuitable measure of the typical economic experience of the nation’s
citizens. Conversely, the time-average (DDP per capita) growth rate may reﬂect how citizens expe-

3This nomenclature is standard.
For example, Milanovic (2005) uses the adjective “plutocratic” to describe
statistics with this property. We make the term mathematically precise in Section 2.
4Existing names for the same concept are the “people’s growth rate” (Milanovic, 2005; Saez and Zucman, 2019)
and the “population-weighted growth rate” (Milanovic, 2005). As far as we know, the distinction between the two
growth rates was ﬁrst drawn by Chenery et al. (1974), when discussing diﬀerent ways to weight quintile average
income growth rates to obtain a single indicator of economic performance.

rience the economy, but it is not a good measure of what’s happening to total productive capacity.
The tension between these two growth rates gives rise to a natural measure of inequality (Adamou
and Peters, 2016). If the ensemble-average growth rate exceeds the time-average growth rate, i.e.
if GDP per capita grows faster than DDP per capita, then inequality is increasing. If the converse
is true, then inequality is decreasing.
This suggests deﬁning inequality simply as the quantity
which grows at the diﬀerence between the two rates, ensemble-average minus time-average. We
call this inequality measure the ergodicity gap. Under multiplicative growth, it corresponds to an
established inequality metric: the mean logarithmic deviation (MLD), also known as the second
index of Theil (1967). At perfect equality, the ergodicity gap vanishes, and GDP per capita and
DDP per capita are equal.
Computing the time-average (DDP per capita) growth rate as the average of individual growth
rates requires, prima facie, hard-to-obtain panel data. However, we show that this growth rate
and, by extension, the ergodicity gap (MLD) depend only on the initial and terminal income
distributions. They do not depend on the reordering of individuals that occurs in-between, i.e.
they are independent of rank mobility. This has the practical beneﬁt of allowing their estimation
using cross-sectional income data.
Our contribution is twofold. First, we relate the ensemble-average and time-average growth rates
of ergodicity economics to the two types of growth measure discussed in the literature. We use
them to deﬁne a fundamental measure of inequality. To better inform policymaking, we propose
that national statistical authorities compile and report all three measures. Second, we illustrate
potential uses for these statistics by studying their strikingly diﬀerent evolutions in the United
States and France over the past ﬁfty years.
The existence of the two growth measures raises the possibility of political disconnect. To a central
planner, say the government in Washington, DC, the most visible ﬁgure is GDP. It is an accurate
measure of the nation’s productive capacity and central planners are right to be interested in it.
But the situation may arise, and data suggest it has arisen, where ensemble-average growth is
consistently faster than time-average growth. Central planners may see ‘the economy’ doing well
while, on the ground, individuals are doing less well. If allowed to persist, this situation can lead
to a disconnect between the central government and the typical citizen.
Citizens may feel left
behind, excluded from economic prosperity, or even lose faith in their institutions and press, who
promulgate statistics that paint a picture of prosperity unrecognisable to most.

The two growth rates of the economy
Ergodicity economics places great emphasis on the functional form of the growth rate (Peters and
Adamou, 2018; Peters, 2019). In simple terms, a growth rate extracts the scale parameter of time
in a growth function.
Diﬀerent types of growth correspond to diﬀerent growth functions and,
therefore, to diﬀerent growth rates. For example, a quantity that grows linearly in time according
2


--- Page 4 ---
to the growth function y = rt, has its growth rate extracted by the operation dy/dt = r; while
under an exponential growth function, y = exp(rt), the growth rate is extracted by d ln y/dt = r. In
both cases, a constant is obtained from a time-varying function. At a deeper level, and generalising
to growth with ﬂuctuations, the role of the growth rate is to extract a stationary mathematical
object – speciﬁcally an ergodic observable – from a model of a growing observable. This is achieved
by identifying an ergodicity transformation, which maps the observable of interest (here, income)
to an observable whose rate of change is ergodic. Finding this transformation is often a powerful
step in ergodicity economics, as we shall see in Section 2.3. In the model of income we use here, we
show that the transformation is simple (the logarithm) and we do not dwell on its deeper meaning.
2.1
Random multiplicative growth
In random multiplicative growth, income obeys Gibrat’s law of proportionate eﬀect (Gibrat, 1931),
i.e. incomes are multiplied by random variables at successive time steps. Variants of this model
have been studied since the 1930s.
We recommend Aitchison and Brown (1957, Ch. 11) for a
review of early research and Gabaix et al. (2016) for up-to-date coverage. We consider random
multiplicative growth a null model of income, which captures two dominant eﬀects: that incomes
ﬂuctuate; and that they do so in proportion to themselves.5
We consider a model population of N people, labelled i = 1 . . . N, whose incomes, xi(t), are
functions of time. Income is measured in units of currency per unit time, e.g. dollars per year, and
is always positive. Income at one observation time is the income at the previous observation time
multiplied by a random variable,
x(t + δt) = x(t)(1 + ϵ) ,
(2.1)
where δt is the time between observations and ϵ is the random variable. (2.1) deﬁnes a stochastic
process which generates trajectories of income,
x(t + Tδt) = x(t)
T
Y
τ=1
(1 + ϵτ) ,
(2.2)
where ϵτ is the realisation of ϵ corresponding to the τ th observation. We assume ϵ is stationary,
i.e. that its distribution does not change in time, and that realisations at diﬀerent times τ are
independent. Note that this makes the stochastic process ϵτ ergodic: the time average and ensemble
average of ϵτ are trivially identical.
The rate of change of income over the single time step in (2.1) is δx/δt = x(t)ϵ/δt. This is not
5Changes in income, such pay rises and cuts, are typically expressed as percentages per year, as are changes
in regular outgoings, like housing and transport costs. We do not suggest this captures all aspects of reality that
determine people’s incomes, just the most important ones. We note that predictions about the distribution of income
under random multiplicative growth can be tested empirically (Guvenen et al., 2017) and that extensions to general
growth processes are available (Peters and Adamou, 2018).
3

ergodic because it depends on x(t).6 Therefore, we introduce an ergodicity transformation, i.e. a
function of xi(t) whose rate of change is ergodic. We do this by requiring the change in the function
to be independent of x(t). Taking the logarithm of (2.1) turns the product of income and income
multiplier into a sum, which we rearrange as
ln x(t + δt) −ln x(t) = ln(1 + ϵ) .
(2.3)
This is the desired result: the left-hand side is the additive change of transformed income; the
right-hand side is a stationary random variable with no x-dependence.
The rate of change,
g = δ ln x(t)/δt, is now ergodic, ⟨g⟩= ¯g, and we call it the ergodic growth rate.7
Since this analysis does not depend on the length of time, δt, between observations, we write the
growth rate of individual income over a general time period from time t to time t + ∆t as
gi = ∆ln xi(t)
∆t
,
(2.6)
where ∆ln xi(t) = ln xi(t + ∆t) −ln xi(t) is the change in the logarithm of the ith income.
2.2

We denote by ⟨x(t)⟩N the population-average income,
⟨x(t)⟩N ≡1

(2.7)
which we can compute from observations of real incomes (or estimate from partial data). In a
model of income dynamics, in which we can generate as many model incomes as we like, the
ensemble-average income, ⟨x(t)⟩, is the N →∞limit of the population-average income,
⟨x(t)⟩≡lim
N→∞⟨x(t)⟩N .
(2.8)
In practice, the national populations we study are large enough for diﬀerences between modelled
6The ensemble-average is ⟨δx/δt⟩= x(t) ⟨ϵ⟩/δt. The time-average is the average value of δx/δt along an income
trajectory, which will diverge or be zero depending on whether x(t) grows or decays.

values of ⟨x(t)⟩and ⟨x(t)⟩N to be negligible (see Appendix A for details). Therefore, we shall
refer to both quantities as the ensemble-average income, using the subscript N to distinguish the
ﬁnite-population statistic from that of the inﬁnite ensemble.
The ensemble-average income, being the total personal income of a population divided by the
number of people, resembles the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. We shall make this
association explicit throughout the text.
The ensemble-average income (GDP per capita) grows at the rate
g⟨⟩≡∆ln ⟨x(t)⟩
∆t
.
(2.9)
or, for a ﬁnite population, at the rate
g⟨⟩N ≡∆ln ⟨x(t)⟩N
∆t
.
(2.10)
We call this the ensemble-average growth rate of income (GDP per capita growth rate).8
If changes in income are small, then we can approximate the ensemble-average (GDP per capita)
growth rate as a weighted average of individual growth rates
g⟨⟩N ≈
N

(2.15)
where each person’s growth rate is weighted by their share of the total income, wi = xi/ PN

The ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate is, therefore, a plutocratic measure of growth
(Milanovic, 2005), in the sense that each person’s weight in the average is proportional to their
income.
8What we call the ensemble-average growth rate (GDP per capita growth rate) is the growth rate of the ensemble
average (GDP per capita) and, we stress, not the ensemble average of the growth rate.

2.3
Time-average growth rate
Whereas the ensemble-average growth rate requires a model where we can average over indeﬁnitely
many individuals, the time-average growth rate of income requires just one modelled individual but
an indeﬁnitely long income trajectory. It is deﬁned as the ∆t →∞limit of the individual growth
rate in (2.6),
¯g ≡
lim
∆t→∞
∆ln xi(t)
∆t
.
(2.16)
Conceptually, therefore, the time-average growth rate measures the typical growth of an individual,
experienced in a single income trajectory unfolding over time.
Alternatively, ¯g can be expressed as a time average if we partition the period ∆t into T shorter
periods of ﬁxed duration δt:
¯g = lim
T→∞

τ=0
δ ln xi(t + τδt)

.
(2.17)
Thus we see that the two diﬀerent procedures – computing a long-time growth rate and averaging
a short-time growth rate over many time steps – are equivalent. This convenient property follows
from our deﬁnition of the growth rate as the (additive) rate of change of a function of the process.
Of course, we cannot compute any inﬁnite-time limit from data of real incomes. However, we can
exploit the ergodicity of the growth rate, ¯g = ⟨g⟩, derived in Section 2.1, to express the time-average
growth rate as an ensemble average,
¯g =
∆ln x(t)
∆t

,
(2.18)
which for a large population we can estimate as a ﬁnite-N average,
¯gN ≡
∆ln x(t)
∆t

N
.
(2.19)
(2.19) is our practical deﬁnition of the time-average growth rate of income.
Our ability to estimate the time-average growth rate as an ensemble average is worth pondering.
At any moment in time there exists a long income trajectory that would result from experiencing
the ensemble of short-time ergodic growth rates in sequence. We speculate that this momentary
estimate of the long-time growth rate corresponds closely to how an economy feels to an individ-
ual. It tells the individual what he or she can expect in the long run if the balance of risks and
opportunities stays the same.10
10Another interpretation of ¯gN is the growth rate a hypothetical person would experience if they spent 1/N of
each year growing like every person in the population. Since ¯gN = ⟨g⟩N, we have
x(t) exp(¯gN∆t) = x(t) exp

This everyman growing at ¯gN, unlike his lucky compatriot growing at g⟨⟩N , shares in all of the experiences of the

The time-average growth rate is an average of individual growth rates, in which each person’s
growth rate has equal weight.
This makes it a democratic measure of growth, as explained in
Section 1, and we also call it the DDP per capita growth rate.
DDP per capita is the quantity, y(t), that grows at the time-average growth rate, i.e. y(t + ∆t) =
y(t) exp(¯gN∆t). Rearranging gives the DDP per capita as
y(t) = exp(⟨ln x(t)⟩N) ,
(2.21)
which is the geometric mean income and has the same units as income.
(2.19) demonstrates that knowledge of individual growth rates is unnecessary for computing ¯gN.
We need only the values of ⟨ln x⟩N at the start and end of the observation period. This has practical
importance, since reliable panel data, required for estimating individual growth rates, are harder
to obtain than data on the initial and terminal distributions. It also means that ¯gN is independent
of income mobility, i.e. of the reordering that takes place between observations.
2.4
Inequality
The ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate and time-average (DDP per capita) growth
rate are conceptually diﬀerent. The former is the growth rate of the average (or, multiplying by N,
the total) income in a large population. The latter is the growth rate achieved by a single member
of the population over long time. Under multiplicative growth, and in general, these growth rates
do not have the same value.
We can show this by a simple thought experiment: suppose all N incomes in a population are equal
at time t, i.e. xi(t) = x(t) for all i, and that they evolve to diﬀerent incomes, xi(t + ∆t), at time
t + ∆t. The ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate is
g⟨⟩N = ln ⟨x(t + ∆t)⟩N −ln ⟨x(t)⟩N
∆t
(2.22)
and the time-average (DDP per capita) growth rate is
¯gN = ⟨ln x(t + ∆t)⟩N −⟨ln x(t)⟩N
∆t
.
(2.23)
Since the logarithm is a concave function, the famous result of Jensen (1906) implies that the
diﬀerence between the growth rates is non-negative, i.e.
g⟨⟩N −¯gN = 1
∆t [ln ⟨x(t + ∆t)⟩N −⟨ln x(t + ∆t)⟩N] ≥0 ,
(2.24)
vanishing only if the xi(t + ∆t) are equal.
national economy in a single year. A truly representative agent.

This thought experiment is illuminating: we started with perfect income equality, moved to a state
of income inequality, and found that g⟨⟩N > ¯gN. In general, if the ensemble-average growth rate
is higher than the time-average growth rate (GDP per capita grows faster than DDP per capita),
then the current high earners grew faster than the low earners over the observation window, and
inequality increased. If the converse is true, then inequality decreased.
In this picture, a natural measure of inequality (of which myriad measures exist in the literature)
is the quantity which grows at the diﬀerence between the two growth rates (Adamou and Peters,
2016). We call this measure the ergodicity gap and denote it by J(t) to highlight its connection to
Jensen (1906). We have
∆J
∆t = g⟨⟩N −¯gN = ∆ln ⟨x⟩N
∆t
−∆⟨ln x⟩N
∆t
,
(2.25)
which, integrated over time, gives the ergodicity gap as
J(t) = ln ⟨x(t)⟩N −⟨ln x(t)⟩N ,
(2.26)
up to an additive constant. J(t) is an established income inequality measure, known as the mean
logarithmic deviation (MLD) and also as the second Theil index (Theil, 1967).11
2.5
Example: geometric Brownian motion
The results above are valid for any large population in which incomes are assumed to follow random
multiplicative growth. Here we study a simple example of such dynamics: geometric Brownian
motion (GBM). We do this to show how the quantities we have deﬁned – the ensemble-average
(GDP per capita) growth rate, the time-average (DDP per capita) growth rate, and the ergodicity
gap (MLD) – behave in an analytically solved case.
GBM is a continuous-time model of income in which relative changes are normally distributed.
Each income xi(t) obeys the Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equation,
dxi = xi(µdt + σdWi) ,
(2.27)
where µ and σ are the drift and volatility parameters, dxi is the inﬁnitesimal change in income, dt
is the inﬁnitesimal change in time, and dWi ∼N(0, dt) is the inﬁnitesimal increment in a Wiener
process. Because the model is well known, we only list the key model properties here, leaving
derivations to Appendix B.
Under GBM, the ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate of income is
g⟨⟩= ∆ln ⟨x⟩
∆t
= µ ,
(2.28)
11In general, the form of the ergodicity gap, like the form of the ergodic growth rate, depends on the transformation
required to make income changes ergodic. Here, under multiplicative dynamics, this transformation is logarithmic.
8


--- Page 10 ---
and the time average growth rate (DDP per capita growth rate) of income is
¯g = ∆⟨ln x⟩
∆t
= µ −σ2
2 .
(2.29)
Thus, the ensemble-average income (GDP per capita) grows faster than a single income trajectory
in the long-time limit. This serves as a concrete example of the more abstract result in (2.24)
and it has an important corollary: using the ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate as
the principal growth measure can create a misleading impression.
In GBM, it is a systematic
overestimate of how individual citizens experience the economy, as captured by the time-average
(DDP per capita) growth rate.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of income and growth at the ensemble-average (GDP per capita)
and time-average (DDP per capita) growth rates under GBM. The diﬀerence, both conceptual and
quantitative, between these growth rates is the central observation in this study.
Figure 1: The distribution of income in GBM. The blue line is the ensemble-average income (GDP
per capita), while the red line is the DDP per capita, which grows at the time-average growth rate.
In the left panel, the thin dark lines are 200 simulated individual income trajectories. In the right
panel the shaded areas represent one (darker shade) and two (lighter shade) standard deviations
from the DDP per capita. The parameters used are µ = 0.05 year−1 and σ = 0.2 year−1
2 . We
assume the initial income is $104/year.
The ergodicity gap (MLD), J(t), grows at the diﬀerence between the ensemble-average (GDP per
capita) and time-average (DDP per capita) growth rates. In the GBM model, this diﬀerence is
dJ
dt = g⟨⟩−¯g = σ2
2 ,
(2.30)
such that
J(t) = σ2t

(2.31)
up to an additive constant. As the distribution of income broadens with time, so income inequality
– as measured by the ergodicity gap (MLD) – increases without bound.
9

GBM is a model in which members of an ensemble grow their incomes exponentially and randomly,
without ever interacting. In particular, there is no reallocation of income between members, as
might happen in a real economy with social institutions (Berman, Peters and Adamou, 2020). It
paints a stark picture in which the aggregate income grows systematically faster than the typical
income, an unintuitive result made possible only by ever-increasing inequality. Such phenomena
are inherently interesting to economists, policymakers, and indeed citizens. They become easier to
detect when the ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate, time-average (DDP per capita)
growth rate, and ergodicity gap (MLD) are reported.

Growth rates in the United States and France
To demonstrate the diﬀerences between ¯gN and g⟨⟩N , we use income data from the United States
and France over the last 50 years.12 Figure 2 presents the evolution of ¯gN and g⟨⟩N in these two
countries. It also shows the evolution of GDP per capita and DDP per capita.
In the United States, ensemble-average income growth (GDP per capita growth) and time-average
income growth (DDP per capita growth) were similar between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s.
Between 1966 and 1980, the ensemble-average income increased by 13% and the time-average
income increased by 16%. Since 1980, there has been a clear divergence. Ensemble-average growth
totalled +40% between 1980 and 2014, whereas time-average growth totalled +20%. This makes
ensemble-average growth (meaning GDP per capita growth) a misleading quantity to follow in the
United States, if the wellbeing of individuals is of interest.
In France, by contrast, the two growth rates were much closer. The ensemble-average (GDP per
capita) growth rate does not create a misleading picture of the typical economic experience of
France’s citizens and it closely resembles the time-average (DDP per capita) growth rate. This
means that a multiplicative growth model with random shocks may be inappropriate in this case.
Eﬀects that lead to divergence of incomes may be weaker here, or eﬀects that lead to convergence
may be stronger. We study a model that can capture such eﬀects in Berman, Peters and Adamou
(2020).
12g⟨⟩N is easily estimated by using the average national income for ⟨x⟩N in (2.22). Calculating ¯gN using (2.23)
requires estimating ⟨ln x⟩N, which is done using income quantile data (see Appendix C).

and the time-average (red) growth rates in the United States (left) and in France (right). Bottom:
the evolution of ensemble-average income (GDP per capita) and DDP per capita in the United
States (left) and in France (right). All data were taken from The World Inequality Database (2020).
We note that the time-average growth rate is estimated by considering the changes in the geometric
mean income each year and not by averaging over all individual growth rates (see Appendix A for
more details). We also truncated the bottom decile of the distribution (see Appendix D for more
details).
Figure 2 shows that in the United States the ergodicity gap remained stable between 1966 and the
early 1980s. Since then it has grown. In France, the ergodicity gap has been roughly stable since
1970. Figure 3 depicts the evolution of the top 10% income share and the ergodicity gap in the
United States and in France over the last 50 years. It demonstrates that both measures evolve
similarly in both countries.

Discussion
Economic growth is characterised by two growth rates: the ensemble-average (GDP per capita)
growth rate, which is the growth rate of the average income; and the time-average (DDP per

capita) growth rate, achieved by each individual in the long run. When incomes follow random
multiplicative growth, the ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth rate is greater than the time-
average (DDP per capita) growth rate, and inequality – measured as the ergodicity gap (MLD) –
increases indeﬁnitely. From the perspective of ergodicity economics, these results are unsurprising:
they are direct consequences of the non-ergodicity of the stochastic process for income.
The diﬀerence between these growth rates is consequential for policymakers. At present, the most
widely used summary statistic of national economic growth is the ensemble-average (GDP per
capita) growth rate. This captures growth in the nation’s total productive capacity – referred to
colloquially as ‘the size of the economy’ – and is useful. However, in the model, it is systematically
higher than the time-average (DDP per capita) growth rate, which reﬂects the typical individual’s
experience of the economy. If these circumstances were mirrored in reality, preoccupation of pol-
icymakers with ensemble-average (GDP per capita) growth would create a worrying disconnect
between them and the public. There are reasons to believe this situation is present-day reality in
the United States, see Figure 2 and Boushey and Clemens (2018); Saez and Zucman (2019).
We conclude with some interpretations of these fundamental growth rates. The ensemble-average
(GDP per capita) growth rate is the growth rate of average income. By contrast, the time-average
(DDP per capita) growth rate is the average growth rate of income. The former is approximately
the income-weighted average of individual growth rates and we can think of it, therefore, as a ‘one
dollar, one vote’ measure of economic growth (strictly speaking, one dollar per year). The latter is
an equally weighted average of individual growth rates and we can think of it as a ‘one person, one
vote’ measure. Both have their place in the analysis of economic growth.

A
Finite populations
In Section 2 we deﬁned the ensemble-average and time-average growth rates of income.
By
“ensemble-average growth rate” we mean the growth rate of the ensemble average of income (not
the ensemble average of the growth rate). In the random multiplicative growth model, this is:
g⟨⟩≡∆ln ⟨x(t)⟩
∆t
.
(A.1)
The time-average growth rate is the ∆t →∞limit of growth rate of individual income, which we
express as the ensemble average of the ergodic growth rate:
¯g ≡
∆ln x(t)
∆t

.
(A.2)
These are deterministic quantities, which are properties of the model. They can be expressed in
terms of model parameters, as we do for GBM in Section 2.5.
For a ﬁnite population of N individuals, we use the ﬁnite-N versions of these growth rates:
g⟨⟩N = ∆ln ⟨x(t)⟩N
∆t
;
¯gN =
∆ln x(t)
∆t

N
.
(A.3)
These growth rates are statistics that can be computed from observations of a real population. In
the model, they are random variables.
Here we verify that, in a model population of the size of a typical nation, the ﬁnite-N growth rates
in (A.3) are good approximations of their N →∞limits. Our aim is to establish whether these
limiting growth rates would be relevant in practice, if the incomes of a real ﬁnite population were
well described by random multiplicative growth. Of course, unmodelled eﬀects – such as reallocation
of income and correlation of income changes – may be important in reality, and conclusions drawn
from the limiting growth rates of a model may be inapt. In our empirical study in Section 3, we do
not use asymptotic results: rather we estimate ﬁnite-N growth rates and watch them evolve over
time.
We use GBM, presented in Section 2.5 and in greater detail in Appendix B, as our model of
income, where g⟨⟩= µ and ¯g = µ −σ2/2. For the ensemble-average growth rate, we use numerical
simulations with µ = 0.02 per year and σ2 ranging from 0 to 0.09 per year.13 We let N change
from 2 to 107. For each value of σ and N, we simulate one time step (equivalent to one year) in a
GBM starting from a lognormal distribution, and we compute g⟨⟩N . We wish to show that g⟨⟩N is
distributed tightly enough that it is usually closer to µ than to µ −σ2/2. We do this by repeating
the simulation 104 times for each value of σ and N, creating a sample of g⟨⟩N values. We then check
what fraction of the sample satisﬁes g⟨⟩N > µ−σ2/4. The left panel in Figure 4 shows this fraction
as a function of σ and N. It is above 90% for typical national populations and realistic values of σ.
13Realistically, for wealth, σ2 is less than 0.04 per year in the US (Berman, Peters and Adamou, 2020).

We conduct a similar analysis for the time-average growth rate, now requiring that ¯gN is usually
closer to µ −σ2/2 than to µ. Here the analysis is simpler, since in the model ¯gN is just the sample
mean of a normally distributed growth rate. Its sampling distribution is

Geometric Brownian motion
In Section 2.5 we use GBM as an example model of income dynamics. Here we present derivations
of the results described therein.
We recall the basic multiplicative model of income evolution in (2.1),
x(t + δt) = x(t)(1 + ϵ) ,
(B.1)
where δt is the time between income observations and ϵ is a random variable.
In GBM, periodic income multipliers are independent and identically distributed normal random
15


--- Page 17 ---
variables. We introduce this using ﬁnite-size increments. Income evolves as
x(t + δt) = x(t)(1 + µδt + σζ
√
δt) ,
(B.2)
where ζ is a standard normal variate, ζ ∼N(0, 1). The model has two parameters, the drift µ and
the volatility σ. Here µδt is the common deterministic component of the income multiplier, and
σζ
√
δt is the idiosyncratic stochastic part.
In eﬀect, we have chosen ϵ ∼N(µδt, σ2δt) in (B.1). This scaling of mean and variance with time
ensures that the random variable for one long time step has a distribution consistent with that
obtained by summing successive random variables over smaller time steps of equal total duration.
This matters because results should not depend on how we partition time.
Deﬁning the change in income at time t as
δx = x(t + δt) −x(t) ,
(B.3)
we can write (B.2) as
δx = x(t)(µδt + σζ
√
δt) .
(B.4)
We now take the limit δt →0 to obtain an Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equation for income x(t),
dx = x(µdt + σdW) .
(B.5)
Thus we arrive at (2.27) in the main text.
(B.5) is solved by using Itˆo’s formula to ﬁnd the stochastic diﬀerential equation obeyed by ln x(t).
This is a Brownian motion with drift,
d ln x =

which is integrated to give the solution for a single trajectory of the stochastic process,

.
(B.8)
∆t is the period of time over which the process runs and W(∆t) is a Wiener process, with distri-
bution N(0, ∆t).
Distribution
Unlike the general multiplicative process in (B.1), we see from (B.7) that the
change in logarithmic income is normally distributed at all times rather than just for long time.

(B.9)
and it is time-dependent. In particular, its variance grows linearly in ∆t.
Exponential growth
Income grows exponentially. The growth rate,
g = ∆ln x
∆t
,
(B.10)
of a single income over the period ∆t is a random variable, which we can extract from (B.7) as
g = µ −σ2

(B.12)
From these results we derive the ensemble-average and time-average growth rates in a GBM, by
taking the limits N →∞and ∆t →∞respectively.
Ensemble-average growth rate
We recall the deﬁnition of g⟨⟩in (2.9),
g⟨⟩≡∆ln ⟨x(t)⟩
∆t
.
(B.13)
We evaluate this by taking the ensemble average of both sides of (B.8) to get
⟨x(t + ∆t)⟩= ⟨x(t)⟩exp(µ∆t) ,
(B.14)
the growth rate of which we obtain by inspection as
g⟨⟩= µ .
(B.15)
Time-average growth rate
The time-average growth rate is the long-time limit of the individual
growth rate in (B.10), i.e.
¯g ≡
lim
∆t→∞{g} .
(B.16)
The variance of g in (B.12) tends to zero as ∆t →∞. Therefore, the growth rate converges to the
mean of the distribution in this limit, i.e.
¯g = µ −σ2
2 .
(B.17)

Estimating ¯gN with quantile data
The calculation of the time-average (DDP per capita) growth rate in (2.23) requires us to estimate
⟨ln x⟩N at diﬀerent points in time. In practice we do this using quantile average data. Instead of
directly computing
¯gN = ∆⟨ln x⟩N
∆t
,
(C.1)
which would be possible if all N incomes were available, we compute
¯gN ≈
1
Q
PQ
q=1 ∆ln x(q)
∆t
,
(C.2)
where Q is the number of quantiles (e.g. Q = 100 for percentiles) and x(q) is the average value of
x within the qth quantile.
Clearly, the ﬁner the division into quantiles is, the more accurate the approximation becomes. To
validate the values of ¯gN shown in Figure 2, we compare them to values for ¯gN obtained using
the lower and upper thresholds of each quantile as the quantile average. These give crude upper
and lower bounds for ¯gN. Figure 5 shows very little diﬀerence between ¯gN as calculated in (C.2)
and these bounds. We conclude that the sensitivity of our results to division into quantiles is low,
and that (C.2) with percentile averages is a good approximation of the time-average growth rate
in practice.

D
Truncation of data
In Section 2 we show that DDP per capita can be computed as the geometric mean of income. As
such, it requires incomes to be positive and is sensitive to uncertainty in the measurement of low
incomes. Therefore, we present results in Figure 2 using truncated data, where the bottom 10% of
incomes are excluded from the calculation of growth rates and average incomes.
Figure 6 explains why we chose to truncate at this percentile. It shows how the growth of GDP
per capita and DDP per capita in the United States and France depend on the fraction of incomes
excluded from their computation. Truncating at percentile 1 means that all percentiles are included,
while truncating at percentile 100 means that only the top percentile is included (in which case
GDP per capita and DDP per capita coincide by construction). In between, DDP per capita growth
changes rapidly when the point of truncation varies from percentile 1 to 10, and more slowly after
19


--- Page 21 ---
that. This reﬂects the well-known fact that geometric means are sensitive to changes in small-
value data. The arithmetic mean, used to compute GDP per capita, is less sensitive to truncation.
Speciﬁcally, it shows no major change in truncation-dependence around percentile 10.

the distribution. We draw similar conclusions about the diﬀerences between the United States and
France as we do from the truncated data in Figure 2.
