Optimal 
Taxation 
and 
Public 
Production 
I: 
Production 
Eficiency 
By PETER A. DIAMOND AND JAMES A. MIRRLEESS* 
Theories of optimal production in a 
planned economy have usually assumed 
that the tax system can allow the govern- 
ment to achieve any desired redistribution 
of property.' On the other hand, some 
recent discussions of public investment 
criteria have tended to ignore taxation as 
a complementary method of controlling 
the economy.2 Although lump sum trans- 
fers of the kind required for full optimality3 
are not feasible today, commodity and 
income taxes can certainly be used to in- 
crease welfare.4 We shall therefore examine 
the maximization of social welfare using 
both taxes and public production as con- 
trol variables. In doing so, we intend to 
bring together the theories of taxation, 
public investment, and welfare economics. 
There are two main results of the study: 
the demonstration of the desirability of 
aggregate production efficiency in a wide 
variety of circumstances provided that 
taxes are set at the optimal level; and an 
examination of that optimal tax structure. 
It is widely known that aggregate produc- 
tion efficiency is desired as one part of 
achieving a Pareto optimum. It is also 
widely known that when the desired 
Pareto optimum cannot be achieved, ag- 
gregate production efficiency may not be 
desirable. Our conclusion differs from these 
results in that production efficiency is 
desirable although a full Pareto optimum 
is not achieved. In the optimum position, 
the presence of commodity taxes implies 
that marginal rates of substitution are not 
equal to marginal rates of transformation. 
Furthermore, the absence of lump sum 
taxes implies that the income distribution 
is not the best that can be conceived. Yet, 
the presence of optimal commodity taxes 
will be shown to imply the desirability of 
aggregate production efficiency. 
This result is similar to that derived by 
Marcel Boiteux, although he considered an 
economy where lump sum redistributions 
of income were possible. Boiteux also ex- 
amined the optimal tax structure that was 
necessary for this result. The optimal tax 
structure for the case of a single consumer 
(or equivalently with lump sum redistribu- 
tion) has also been examined by Frank

taxes, which may vary from individual to individual 
while being uniaffected by the individual's behavior, 
and poll taxes which are the same for all individuals, or 
perhaps for all individuals within several large groups, 
distinguished perhaps by age, sex, or region.

question, see Gerard Debreu (1954).

Ramsey and Paul Samuelson.5 Our results 
move beyond theirs in considering the 
problem of income redistribution together 
with that of raising revenue. Even in the 
absence of government revenue require- 
ments, if lump sum redistribution is im- 
possible, the government will want to use 
its excise tax powers to improve income 
distribution. It will subsidize and tax 
different goods so as to alter individual 
real incomes. The optimal redistribution 
by this method occurs when there is a 
balance between the equity improvements 
and the efficiency losses from further taxa- 
tion. 
The genera] situation we want to discuss 
is an economy in which there are many 
consumers, public and private production, 
public consumption, and many different 
kinds of feasible tax instruments. We 
think that it is easier to understand the 
problem if we present the analysis first for 
a single consumer, no public consumption, 
and only commodity taxation, although 
this case has little intrinsic interest. The 
main point of the paper is that the anal- 
ysis of this special case carries over in the 
main to the general case. 
The first two sections are devoted to this 
special case. In the first, the situation is 
portrayed geometrically (for a two-com- 
modity world with no private production); 
in the second, production efficiency and 
conditions for the optimal taxes are derived 
by application of the calculus. The use of 
the calculus here and elsewhere is not 
perfectly rigorous for the usual reasons. 
These issues are taken up in Section IV. 
In the third section, we extend the analysis 
of production to an economy with many 
consumers, elucidating precise conditions 
under which production efficiency is desir- 
able (and presenting certain exceptions). 
Section IV provides a rigorous statement 
of the theorems. In the fifth section, we 
discuss briefly certain applications and 
extensions of the basic efficiency result. 
A following paper, referred to here as 
Diamond-Mirrlees II, will appear in the 
June 1971 Review. In it we will examine 
the optimality rules for commodity taxes, 
for other taxes including income taxes, 
and for public consumption. We will also 
give a rigorous statement of conditions 
under which the first-order conditions ob- 
tained (heuristically) below are indeed 
necessary conditions. 
I. One-Consumer Economy- 
Geometric Analysis 
We begin by considering an economy 
with a single, price-taking consumer and 
two commodities. We assume, for the 
moment, that all production possibilities 
are controlled by the government. While 
there is no scope for redistribution of 
income in this economy, the government 
might need to raise revenue to cover losses 
if there are increasing returns to scale or 
if there are fixed expenditures (such as 
defense) and constant returns to scale. 
Alternatively, the technology might ex- 
hibit decreasing returns to scale, facing the 
government with the problem of disposing 
of a surplus if all transactions are carried 
out at market prices. The optimal solution 
to either raising or disposing of revenue 
is well known. A poll tax or subsidy, as the 
case may be, will permit the hiring of the 
needed resources and permit the economy 
to achieve a Pareto optimum, which, in a 
one-consumer economy, is equivalent to 
the maximization of the consumer's utility. 
While this is a reasonable possibility in a 
one-consumer economy, lump sum taxes 
varying from individual to individual do 
not seem feasible in a much larger econo- 
my. An identical problem of distributing 
a surplus among many people arises if it is 
desired to improve income distribution. 
5 For a detailed history of analysis of this problem, 
see William Baumol and David Bradford. A summary 
and discussion of the work of Boiteux has been given by 
Jacques Drbze.

Thus we shall consider the use of com- 
modity taxes when lump sum taxes are not 
permitted to the government, not for the 
intrinsic interest of this question in a one- 
consumer economy, but as an introduction 
to the many-consumer case. Furthermore 
we shall hold constant the government 
expenditure pattern which directly affects 
consumer utility. Thus we can ignore it, 
since the utility function already reflects 
its impact. The addition of choice for 
public consumption will be considered in 
Diamond-Mirrlees II. 
I Assuming free disposal, the technologi- 
cal constraint on the planner is that the 
government supply be on or under the 
production frontier. Such a constraint is 
shown by the shaded area in Figure 1. 
Let us measure on the axes the quantities 
supplied to the consumer. Thus, the out- 
put being produced (good 2) is measured 
positively, while the input (good 1) is 
measured negatively. The case drawn is 
the familiar one of decreasing returns to 
scale. If the government needed a fixed 
bundle of resources, for national defense 
say, then the production possibility fron- 
tier (describing the potential transactions 
with the consumer) would not pass through 
the origin. With constant returns to scale 
this might appear as in Figure 2, where a 
units of good 1 are needed for defense. (It 
is perhaps convenient to think of good 1 as 
labor and good 2 as a consumption good.) 
In a totally planned economy, where the 
planner selects a fixed consumption bundle 
(including labor to be supplied) for each 
consumer, the planner would have no fur- 
ther constraint and could choose any 
point that was technologically feasible. 
Again, this is not implausible for the 
planner in a one-consumer economy, but 
becomes so as the number of households 
grows. A more realistic assumption, then, 
is to assume that the planner can only deal 
with consumers through the market place, 
hiring labor and selling the consumer good. 
Assume further that the planner is con- 
strained to charge uniform prices. The 
planner must now set the price of the 
consumer good relative to the wage (or in- 
versely the real wage), and is constrained 
to transactions which the consumer is will- 
ing to undertake at some relative price. 
The locus of consumption bundles which 
the consumer is willing to achieve by trade 
from the origin is the offer curve or price- 
consumption locus. It represents the

bundles of goods that the consumer would 
purchase at different possible price ratios. 
Figure 3 contains an example of an offer 
curve with several hypothetical budget 
lines and the corresponding indifference 
curves drawn in. The planner thus has two 
constraints: he must choose a point which 
is both technologically feasible and an 
equilibrium bundle from the point of view 
of the consumer. Combining these two 
constraints, the range of consumption 
bundles which are both feasible and poten- 
tial consumer equilibria is shown as the 
heavy line in Figure 4. 
We can state these two constraints 
algebraically. Let 
us 
denote by 
z

supply. The production constraint is then

t Now consider the government's objec- 
tives. Since the consumer's equilibrium 
position is determined by the prices he 
faces, we can? in the usual cilrcumstances, 
describe the objective function as a func- 
tion of prices, say v(q). The problem is to 
choose q so as to

many consumers- do-es not alter the form 
of this problem. This 'is'a major advrantage

of using prices rather than quantities as 
the focus of the analysis. 
Let us consider the case where the 
planner seeks to maximize the same func- 
tion of consumption as the consumer's 
utility function. The welfare function is 
said to be individualistic, or to respect indi- 
vidual preferences, since welfare can be 
written as a function of individual utility. 
Returning to Figure 3 we see that the 
consumer moves to higher indifference 
curves as he proceeds along the offer curve 
away from the origin. Thus, in Figure 4 we 
wish to move as far along 00' as possible, 
subject to the constraint of the shaded 
production possibility set. The optimal 
point is therefore A, where the offer curve 
and the production frontier intersect. 
The prices which will induce the con- 
sumer to purchase the optimal consump- 
tion bundle are defined by the budget line 
OA. In Figure 5 we show the optimal point 
and the implied budget line, and indiffer- 
ence curve II. All the points above II and 
in the shaded production set are Pareto- 
superior to A and technologically feasible, 
but not attainable by market transactions 
without lump sum transfers. For contrast, 
in Figure 6, we show the Pareto optimal 
point, B, and the implied budget line, and 
indifference curve I'I', which will permit 
decentralization. In the case drawn, the 
consumer's budget line does not pass 
through the origin; this represents his pay- 
ment of a lump sum tax to cover govern- 
ment expenditures in excess of profits from 
production. 
We see that the optimal point is on the 
production possibility frontier of the 
economy, not inside it. This important 
property of the optimum can easily be seen 
to carry over to the case of many com- 
modities, but still one consumer. With 
many commodities, the offer curve is a 
union of loci, each of which is obtained by 
holding the prices of all but one commodity 
constant and varying the price of that one 
commodity. Doing this for each com-

modity, and for all possible configurations 
of prices for the other commodities, gener- 
ates all the loci. The offer curve is the union 
of such loci. On each locus, the point which 
is also on the production frontier is better 
than the other points on the locus. Thus, 
any point which is not on the production 
frontier is dominated by some point which 
is on the frontier. Therefore, the optimal 
point is one of the points on the frontier. 
The implications of this result will be 
seen more clearly below, when we consider 
both public and private production. For 
this result to carry over to the case of 
many consumers requires one further, mild 
assumption which will be discussed in the 
third section. First, we treat the one con- 
sumer economy algebraically, with both 
public and private production, showing by 
-calculus the desirability of aggregate pro- 
duction efficiency, and obtaining the opti- 
mal relationship between consumer prices 
and the slope of the production possibili- 
ties. This relationship defines the optimal 
tax structure. 
II. One-Consumer Economy- 
Algebraic Analysis 
We assume constant returns to scale in 
the private production sector and the 
presence of competitive conditions there. 
In equilibrium there are, therefore, no 
profits. (This is a critical assumption for 
the efficiency analysis.) We also assume, 
for the present, that the only taxes used by 
the government are commodity taxes.6 
Consumer prices, q, therefore determine 
the choices available to the consumer, and 
we may write the welfare function as a 
function of consumer prices, v(q). Notice 
that this covers the case where the govern- 
ment's assessment of welfare does not 
coincide with the consumer's utility, al- 
though depending on what he consumes. 
In the special case where social preferences 
coincide with those of the single consumer, 
his utility may be taken to measure 
welfare. Then we have 
(4) 
v(q) = u(x(q)) 
We shall not use this special form for v(q) 
in the analysis below until we come to 
evaluate the tax structure explicitly. Until 
that point, the analysis applies also to 
welfare functions that are not individual- 
istic. For later use let us express the deriva- 
tives of v in this special case. Writing 
V, = dv/dqk, u = au/axi, and using (4), we 
have 
(5) 
Vk = 
E ui 
aXk, 
aqk 
where a is a positive constant (i.e., inde- 
pendent of k), the marginal utility of 
income. Equation (5) follows from the 
budget constraint, 
(6) 
E qixi = 0, 
which on differentiation with respect to 
qk yields 
oxi 
(7) 
Xk+ 
qi-=

aqk 
Since utility-maximization implies that 
ui=aqi, 
(5) now follows from (7). 
Production 
Let us denote the vector of prices faced 
by private producers by p = (pi, . . ., 
pn)- 
Because of taxes, t, these may differ from 
the prices faced by consumers: qi=p=+ti 
(i=1, 
. .., 
n). 
y= (yi, . . ., 
y.) 
is the 
vector of commodities privately supplied 
(inputs will thus appear as negative sup- 
plies), and we write the private production 
constraint, 
(8) 
yl = f(y2, *,yn) 
Notice that we assume equality in the 
6 This assumption is made solely for simplicity. In 
Diamond-Mirrlees 
II, the general principles will be seen 
to carry over with additional taxes, including a pro- 
gressive income tax.

production constraint, that is, that pro- 
duction is efficient in the private sector. 
This follows from profit maximization if 
there are no zero prices. We assume thatf 
is a differentiable function, and that 
y$izO (i=11 
... , n). Then, profit maxi- 
mization means that

where fi denotes the derivative of f with 
respect to yi. Also, by the assumption of 
constant returns to scale, maximized 
profits are zero in equilibrium: 
(10) 
Epiyi 
= 0 
So that we may conveniently employ 
calculus, we shall assume that the govern- 
ment production constraint, (1), is satisfied 
with an equality rather than an inequality: 
(11) 
Zl = g(Z2, 
. * * 
zn) 
Thus we do not give the government the 
option of inefficient government produc- 
tion. Rather, we shift our attention to 
aggregate production efficiency. Efficiency 
will be present if marginal rates of trans- 
formation are the same in publicly and 
privately controlled production. It will 
then be seen quite easily that the assump- 
tion of efficiency in the public sector is 
justified. 
Walras' Law 
We have chosen an objective function 
and expressed the government's produc- 
tion constraint above. To complete the 
formulation of the maximization problem, 
it remains to add the requirement that the 
economy be in equilibrium. The conditions 
that all markets clear can be stated in 
terms of the vectors x, y, and z. 
(12) 
x(q)= y+z 
The reader may be puzzled that at no 
place in this formulation has a budget 
constraint been introduced for the govern- 
ment. (Other readers may be puzzled by 
our failure to include only n- 1 markets 
in our market clearance equations. These 
are aspects of the same phenomenon.) 
Walras' Law implies that if all economic 
agents satisfy their budget constraints and 
all markets but one are in equilibrium, theni 
the last market is also in equilibrium. It 
also implies that when all markets clear 
and all economic agents but one are on 
their budget constraints, then the last 
economic agent is on his budget constraint. 
In setting up our problem, we have as- 
sumed that the household and the private 
firms are on their budget constraints. Thus, 
if we assume that all markets clear, this 
will imply that the government is satisfy- 
ing its budget constraint,7 which we can 
express as 
(13) 
E(qi 
- 
p.)xi 
+ 
pizi =0 
- 
E tix + E piz, 
Alternatively, if we consider the govern- 
ment budget balance as one of the con- 
straints, then it is only necessary to im- 
pose market clearance in n-1 
of the 
markets. 
In this model we can make two price 
normalizations, one for each price struc- 
ture. Since both consumer demand and 
firm supply are homogeneous of degree 
zero in their respective prices, changing 
either price level without altering relative 
prices leaves the equilibrium unchanged. 
As normalizations let us assume,

It may seem surprising that it does not 
matter whether the government can tax 
good one. But the reader should remember 
the budget balance of the consumer. Since 
there are no lump sum transfers to the

the government budget is in balance over the horizon of 
the model, not year by year.

consumer, net expenditures are zero. Thus, 
levying a tax at a fixed proportional rate 
on all consumer transactions results in no 
revenue. (It should be noticed that a 
positive tax rate applied to a good sup- 
plied by the consumer is in effect a subsidy 
and results in a loss of revenue to the 
government.) 
Welfare Maximization 
We can now state the maximization 
problem. In the statement we shall use the 
two sets of prices as control variables. It 
would be a more natural approach to use 
the taxes which the government actually 
controls as decision variables. However, 
once we have determined the optimal p 
and q vectors we have determined the 
optimal taxes. Using taxes as decision vari- 
ables complicates the mathematical formu- 
lation and leads to a control problem since 
the tax vector may not uniquely determine 
equilibrium. 
Rather than calculate the first-order 
conditions from the formulation spelled 
out above, we shall alter the problem to 
simplify the derivation. We have to choose

and

g(Z2, 
* * X Z1w) 
Since the choice of producer prices can 
be used to obtain any desired behavior on 
the part of private producers, we can use 
any vector y consistent with the produc- 
tion constraint (8). Producer prices are 
then determined by equation (9). Using 
the equations

Provided that X is unequal to zero (i.e., 
that there is a social cost to a marginal 
need for additional resources), equation 
(20) implies equal marginal rates of trans- 
formation in public and private production 
and thus aggregate production efficiency 
as was argued above. The assumption that 
N 0 needs justification. This is provided 
by the rigorous arguments of Sections III 
and IV. 
If we had introduced several public

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
production sectors, each described by a 
constraint like (11), we should have ob- 
tained an equation of the form (20) for 
each sector. Thus marginal rates of trans- 
formation in all public sectors should be 
equal, since they are all to be equal to the 
private marginal rates of transformation. 
This argument-which we only sketch 
here, since the conclusion will be proved 
more directly in the next section-justifies 
our assumption that there should be pro- 
duction efficiency in the public sector. 
Optimnal Tax Structure 
The relations (19) determine the optimal 
tax structure, since they show how pro- 
ducer and consumer prices should be re- 
lated. These equations show that con- 
sumer prices should be at a level such that 
further increases in any price result in an 
increase in social welfare, Vk, which is the 
same ratio, X, to the cost of satisfying the 
change in demand arising from the price 
increase. Reintroducing taxes explicitly 
into the problem we can obtain an alterna- 
tive interpretation for the first-order con- 
ditions. 
Since xi is a function of p+t, 
aqk 
alk 
(p is held constant in this latter deriva- 
tive.) Consequently, the optimal tax struc- 
ture, (19), can be rewritten:

This. last set of equations asserts the 
proportionality of the marginal utility of a 
change in the price of a commodity to the 
change in tax revenue resulting from a 
change in the corresponding tax rate, cal- 
culated at constant producer prices. Like 
the first-order conditions for the optimum 
in standard welfare economics, our first- 
order conditions are expressions in con- 
stant prices. The tax administrator, like 
the production planner, need not be con- 
cerned with the response of prices to 
government action when looking at the 
first-order conditions. 
If we now make the further assumption 
that the welfare function is individualistic, 
we can use equation (5) to replace Vk. The 
first-order conditions then become 
x a(>3t5x1) 
(23) 
xk = - 
a 
tk 
Thus for all commodities the ratio of 
marginal tax revenue from an increase in 
the tax on that commodity to the quantity 
of the commodity is a constant. This form 
of the first-order conditions has the ad- 
vantage of showing the information needed 
to test whether a tax structure is optimal. 
The amount of information does not seem 
excessive relative to the data and knowl- 
edge which a planner in an advanced 
country should have. 
The statements of the first-order condi- 
tions thus far do not directly indicate the 
size of the tax rates required, nor the im- 
pact upon demand that the optimal tax 
rates would have. In his pioneering study 
of optimal tax structure, Frank Ramsey 
manipulated the first-order conditions so 
as to shed light on the latter question. He 
employed the concept of demand curves 
calculated at a constant marginal utility 
of income. Paul Samuelson reformulated 
this using the more familiar demand 
curves calculated at a constant level of 
utility. We shall return to this question in 
Diamond-Mirrlees II.

III. Production Efficiency in the 
Many-Consumer Economy 
We have remarked already that many 
of the results carry over directly to an 
economy of many consumers, even when 
lump sum taxation is excluded. We notice 
at once that the device of expressing wel- 
fare as a function of the prices, q, faced by 
consumers can be used perfectly well. 
Explicitly, we assume that there are H 
households, with utility and demand func- 
tions Uh and xh (h= 1, 2, . . . , H). If, as we 
may generally suppose, in the absence of 
externalities from producers to consumers, 
social welfare can be expressed as a 
function of the consumption of the 
various consumers in the economy, 
U(xl, x2, 
, xH), it may also be written 
(24) 
V(q) = 
U(x1(q), 
x2(q), 
. . . , XH(q)) 
where we assume that there are no lump 
sum incomes or transfers that would be 
influenced by producer prices or govern- 
ment policy. In the case where social wel- 
fare depends only on individual utility 
and there are no externalities, we can write 
(25) 
V(q) = W[ul(xl(q)), 
u 2(X2 
(q)), 
. 
. 
u(XH(q))] 
where W is presumed to be strictly in- 
creasing in each of its arguments. 
Using this indirect welfare function, we 
can carry out the analysis already pre- 
sented for the one-consumer economy, and 
conclude in the same way that aggregate 
production efficiency is desirable. For that 
argument to be correct, we must confirm 
that the Lagrange multiplier X is not zero. 
Rather than attempt to do this directly, we 
shall present a different argument for the 
desirability of production efficiency. A fur- 
ther condition will be required to secure 
our conclusion. In considering this prob- 
lem, we shall concentrate on the case where 
all production is under government con- 
trol. The desirability of production effi- 
ciency in this case will be seen to imply the 
same conclusion when there is also a 
private sector (provided that private 
producers are price takers, and profits, if 
any, are transferred to the government). 
Assume then (as we did in Section I) that 
all production takes place in the public 
sector: our problem is to find q that will 
(26) 
Maximize V(q), 
subject to G(X(q)) < 0, 
where we define X(q) = Eh xh(q) as aggre- 
gate demand at prices q. We shall also 
express the production constraint a little 
more generally by saying that X(q) is to 
belong to the production set G, the set of 
technologically feasible production plans. 
(Thus the letter G denotes both the pro- 
duction set, and also the function that can 
be used to describe it; but we shall hardly 
ever use thefunction G explicitly). 
Suppose we establish that, at the opti- 
mum for problem (26), production is 
efficient. Consider an economy with the 
same technolgical possibilities, partly un- 
der the control of private, competitive 
producers. The government can induce 
private firms to produce any efficient net 
output bundle by suitable choice of pro- 
ducer prices p. In particular, it can obtain 
the production plan that would be optimal 
if the government controlled all produc- 
tion. The choice of p does not affect con- 
sumer demands or welfare, since pure 
profit arising from decreasing returns to 
scale go to the government, and since, any 
commodity taxes being possible, q can be 
chosen independently of p. Thus, if the 
solution to (26) is efficient, the same equi- 
librium can be achieved when some pro- 
duction is under private control, and is 
optimal in that case too. Proof that pro- 
duction efficiency is desirable in the "spe- 
cial" case (26) therefore implies that pro-

duction efficiency is desirable in the more 
general case. 
Examples of Inefficiency 
Before considering the argument for 
efficiency, it is useful to consider some 
limitations on that argument as demon- 
strated by the following examples of de- 
sired inefficiency. It will be recollected that 
a production plan is efficient if any other 
feasible production plan provides a smaller 
net supply of at least one commodity. We 
shall use a different concept: we say that a 
production plan is weakly efficient if it is 
on the production frontier. It is possible 
for a production plan to be weakly efficient 
without being efficient if the production 
frontier has vertical or horizontal portions. 
For matters of economic importance, such 
as the existence of shadow prices, weak 
efficiency is all that is required. It is easy 
to see that if all the prices corresponding to 
a weakly efficient production plan are 
positive, the plan is in fact efficient in the 
usual sense. 
Even with this slightly weakened con- 
cept of efficiency, it is not necessarily true 
that, when an optimum exists, optimal 
production has to be weakly efficient. We 
present two examples. 
Example a is portrayed in Figure 7. It is 
a one-consumer economy where social 
preferences, as depicted in the social in- 
difference curve II, do not coincide with 
individual preferences. It is evident that, 
in the case shown, the optimal production 
plan is actually in the interior of the pro- 
duction set. 
In the second example, social preferences 
do respect household preferences, but 
again optimal production lies in the inte- 
rior of the production set, and is therefore 
not weakly efficient: suitable producer 
prices cannot be found, and the social 
optimum cannot be obtained when there 
is private control of production. 
Example b. There are two commodities 
and two households. One has utility func- 
tion x2y, the other has utility function 
xy2; each has the nonnegative quadrant 
{(x, y)lx> O, y 2 O} as consumption set. 
The first consumer has three units of the 
first commodity initially; the second, one 
unit of the second commodity. The welfare 
function is 
1 
1 
xlyl 
x2y2 
The second commodity can be trans- 
formed into the first according to the 
production relation x+10y : O, (x>O). 
Let the prices of the commodities be qi, q2. 
Then the first household's net demands 
are 
- 
1 of the first commodity, 
ql/q2 
of the second commodity. 
The second household has net demands

Thus, the net market demand for the 
commodities is

These must satisfy

Welfare is - q2/4q1- 27q1/4q2 which is 
maximized when q2/qI=3 V3: the corre- 
sponding production vector V\3-1, 3(V,\/ 
-1) is actually interior to the production 
set, not on the frontier. This example has 
the unimportant peculiarity that initial 
endowments of the consumers are on the 
frontiers of their consumption sets. More 
complicated examples avoiding the peculi- 
arity have been constructed. 
The Efficiency Argument 
Despite these examples, the following 
argument shows that optimal production 
will generally be on the production fron- 
tier. Suppose that the aggregate demand 
functions, X(q), are continuous. Then any 
small change in the prices, q, will not 
change aggregate production requirements 
by much. Therefore, if optimal production 
were in the interior of the production set, 
small changes in consumer prices would 
still result in technologically feasible aggre- 
gate demands. Thus, if we are at the opti- 
mum, small changes in consumer prices 
cannot increase welfare. If we can argue 
that, at the optimum, there exists a small 
price change which would increase V(q), 
we can conclude that production for the 
optimum must occur on the production 
frontier. For any unsatiated single con- 
sumer, utility can be increased either by 
lowering the price of a supplied good or 
raising the price of a demanded good (as 
we can see, algebraically, in equation (5)). 
With a single consumer, we need not argue 
further, provided the equilibrium involves 
some trade. When there are many con- 
sumers, we can be certain of increasing 
welfare if we raise some consumer's utility 
without lowering that of anyone else. If 
there is a commodity that no consumer 
purchases, but some consumer supplies 
(such as certain labour skills); or a good 
(with positive price) which no consumer 
supplies, but some consumer purchases 
(such as electricity), we could alter the 
price of that commodity in such a way as 
to bring about an unambiguous increase 
in welfare. In that case, we conclude that 
efficient production is required for the 
maximization of individualistic social wel- 
f are. In example b, it will be seen that 
neither of the commodities is supplied, or 
demanded, by both consumers. The very 
simplicity of the case appears to be mis- 
leading. 
A formal presentation of this argument 
is given in the next section: these technical 
details can be omitted without loss of 
continuity. We conclude this section by 
introducing further taxes into the dis- 
cussion. 
First, consider the case of a poll tax (or 
subsidy)-that is, a tax is paid by a house- 
hold on the basis of some unalterable 
property, such as its sex or age distribu- 
tion. Such a tax is, of course, a lump sum 
tax, although its availability is not, in 
general, sufficient to enable the full opti- 
mum to be achieved. To fix ideas, suppose 
there is a single transfer, r, to be made to 
all households. Then welfare can be written 
V(q, r), and we are to 
(27) 
Maximize V(q, r) 
subject to X(q, r) being in G 
The standard efficiency argument can be 
used. Let (q*, r*) be the optimum: if any 
small change in q or r would increase V, 
optimal production, X(q*, r*) must be on 
the production frontier (assuming that X 
is a continuous function). Now a poll 
subsidy must make everyone better off, 


--- Page 13 ---
20 
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
unless some are already satiated, and so 
must a small increase in subsidy. Thus so 
long as a poll subsidy is possible (and it 
surely is) and not every household is 
satiated, optimal production must be on 
the frontier. 
Adding further tax instruments to the 
government's armoury in no way weakens 
the efficiency conclusion. We simply note 
that if there are other tax variables which 
are independent of producer prices and 
quantities, denoted collectively by ?, we 
can hold them constant at their optimum 
values t*, and then apply the efficiency 
argument to the problem (27) or (26), 
where V and X are evaluated for 
= *. 
Our final conclusion is that whatever 
the class of possible tax systems, if all 
possible commodity taxes are available to 
the government, then in general, and cer- 
tainly if a poll subsidy is possible, optimal 
production is weakly efficient. We would 
not expect this conclusion to be valid if 
there were constraints on the possibilities 
of commodity taxation, or more generally, 
on the possible relationship between pro- 
ducer prices and consumer demand. The 
presence of pure profits is one example of 
such a relationship. To show what goes 
wrong, suppose, by way of another ex- 
ample, that no commodity taxes are possi- 
ble, but a poll tax is possible, and that part 
of production is privately controlled, in 
such a way that it is uniquely determined 
by producer prices. Then we have to 
choose a public production vector z and 
a poll tax X to 
(28) 
Maximize V(p, r) 
subject to X(p, r) - y(p) = z being in G, 
where y(p) is the private production vector 
when prices are p. Following the argument 
used above, we consider r smaller than 
r*, the optimum level, and note that 
V(p*, r) > V(p*, r*). This implies that 
X(p*, r) - y(p*) is not in G, and therefore 
z*, the optimal z, is efficient in G. But the 
argument does not imply that the aggre- 
gate optimal production plan, y(p*) +z* is 
efficient. Of course, in an economy where 
all production is under public control, 
these problems do not arise. Even when 
some of the qk are fixed, the efficiency argu- 
ment holds, for there can be no necessary 
relation between q and p. 
IV. Theorems on Optimal Production 
In this section, we explore the existence 
of the optimum, and the efficiency of opti- 
mal production, rigorously. We rely on 
Debreu (1959) for the results of general 
equilibrium theory that are required. 
Assumptions 
There are H households in the economy, 
each household choosing a preferred net 
consumption vector x from his consump- 
tion set C subject to the budget constraint 
q * x 0 O where q is the vector of prices 
charged to consumers. (Consumption is 
measured net of initial endowment for 
convenience, since the latter is unaltered 
in the analysis.) As usual the net demand 
vector x has, in general, both positive and 
negative components corresponding to 
purchases and sales by the household. 
The assumptions used below will be 
selected from the following list (the super- 
script h refers to the index of households; 
all assumptions, when made, hold for all 
h): 
(a.1) 
Ch is closed, convex, bounded be- 
low by a vector al, and contains a 
vector with every component nega- 
tive. 
(a.2) The preference ordering is con- 
tinuous. 
(a.3) The preference ordering is strongly 
convex. Formally, if x2 is preferred 
or indifferent to xl and 0 <t <1, 
then tx2+(1-t)xl 
is strictly pre- 
ferred to xl. 
(a.4) There is no satiation consumption 
in C".

DIAMOND AND MIRRLEES: OPI'MIAL TAXATION 
21 
Assumptions (a.t) and (a.2) guarantee 
the existence of continuous utility func- 
tions, which we shall write uh (see Debreu 
Section 4.6). Furthermore, under (a. 1)- 
(a.3), when the demand vector xh(q) is 
defined, it is uniquely defined. When Ch 
is bounded, assumptions (a.1)-(a.3) imply 
that xh(q) is defined and continuous at all 
non-zero nonnegative q. (See Debreu, Sec- 
tion 4.10.) 
Let us denote aggregate demand by 
X(q) = 7hXh(q). 
It is assumed that all production is con- 
trolled by the government. The assump- 
tions on the production possibility set, G, 
will be taken from the following set: 
(b. 1) Every production plan in which 
nothing is produced in a positive 
quantity is possible: i.e., if z<0, 
z is in G. 
(b.2) Complete inactivity is possible: 
i.e., 0 is in G. 
(b.3) G is closed. 
(b.4) There exists a vector a such that 
z_a J for all nonnegative z in the 
convex closure of G. (i.e., the 
closure of the convex hull of G).8 
(b.5) G is convex. 
The welfare function will be denoted by 
U(X1, 
.. 
, xH). When demands are func- 
tions of prices only we can define the in- 
direct welfare function as 
V(q) = U(xl(q), . . , x"(q)) 
Similarly we can define an individual's 
indirect utility function by 
Vh (q) 
= 
Uh(Xh (q)) 
We shall say that the welfare function re- 
spects household preferences when U can be 
written 
U(x1, 
- . 
, xH) 
= 
W(U'(X'), 
. 
. 
. 
, uil(XH)) 
with W increasing in each argument. We 
shall assume 
(c.1) 
U is a continuous function of 
(X', 
. .. ' 
xHI) 
We can now state our problem as trying 
to find q* to maximize V(q) subject to 
X(q) being in G. A commodity vector will 
be called attainable if it is feasible and if 
there exists prices such that aggregate 
demand equals the vector. The set of all 
such vectors, the attainable set, is the in- 
tersection of G with the set of vectors X(q) 
for all nonnegative q. 
Existence of an Optimum 
If we assume that the attainable set 
is nonempty and bounded, we obtain 
THEOREM 1. If assumptions (a.1)-(a.3), 
(b.3), and (c.1) hold, and if the attainable set 
is nonempty and bounded, an optimum 
exists. 
PROOF: 
Consider an economy in which the con- 
sumption sets are truncated by removing 
from them all points x with ||x|| >M, 
where all vectors in the attainable set 
satisfy ||x|| <M. For this truncated econ- 
omy, the demand functions are continuous 
at all price vectors not equal to zero. Since 
the attainable set, and demands for any q 
corresponding to an attainable vector, are 
the same in the original and truncated 
economies, an optimum for the truncated 
economy is an optimum for the original 
economy. In other words, we may, without 
loss of generality, assume that demands 
are continuous at q $0. Since the demand 
functions are homogeneous of degree zero 
in the prices, we can restrict our attention 
to q satisfying q 0 and E i q= 1. 
We next demonstrate that the set 
{qjX(q) in G} is closed. Let qn be a se- 
quence of price vectors converging to q', 
with X(q.) in G for all n. Let x' be a limit 
point of { X(q.) }. Since G is closed, x' is 
8 When G is convex, this assumption is similar to 
the assumption that inputs are required to obtain out- 
puts, but permits the government to own a vector of 
inputs.

in G. At the same time, x= X(q'), 
by the continuity of X. Thus q' is in 
qjI X(q) in G}, which is therefore closed. 
Since the attainable set is nonempty, 
and prices are in any case bounded, 
{qI X(q) in G} is closed, bounded, and non- 
empty. By the continuity of the demand 
functions, and assumption (c.1), V is a 
continuous function of q, which there- 
fore attains its maxim um on the set 
{qj X(q) in G}. 
One criterion for the attainable set to be 
nonempty follows immediately from the 
existence of competitive equilibrium in an 
exchange economy: 
THEOREM 2. If assumptions (a.l)-(a.4) 
and (b.1) hold, the attainable set is non- 
empty. 
PROOF: 
See Debreu (Section 5.7) for a proof that 
there exists an equilibrium for the ex- 
change economy with these consumers. 
The equilibrium prices result in a feasible 
demand. 
If the production set is taken to be the 
set of possible production vectors net of 
government consumption, the assumption 
that zero production is possible is ex- 
cessively strong, especially for govern- 
ments with large military establishments. 
But it is easy to construct examples of 
economies not satisfying (b.1) in which 
there is no attainable point. Consider the 
one-consumer economy depicted in ex- 
ample c shown in Figure 8. 
The boundedness of the attainable set 
would be implied by the boundedness of 
the consumption sets, or the boundedness 
of production, but the following case is 
more appealing: 
THEOREM 3. If assumptions (a.1) and 
(b.2)-(b.4) hold, then the attainable set is 
bounded.9 
PROOF: 
Suppose the attainable set is not 
bounded. Then there exists a sequence of 
attainable vectors x,, such that jjxnli is an 
unbounded increasing sequence of real 
numbers. There exists an n' such that 
JIx.I I >1 ||a|, where d is the vector employed 
in (b.4). Consider the sequence of vectors 
(IIxn,|I/IIxn|I)xn 
for n >n'. Each vector is in 
the convex hull of G (being a convex 
combination of the origin and xn). Further 
the sequence is bounded. Thus there is a 
limit point, i, which is in the convex 
closure of G and satisfies IWI||>jIa|j. 
Let 
b- E 
a, 
where ah are the vectors 
employed in (a.1). Then 
Xn= >hxd 
_ 
Ehah=b. 
Further (IIxn |j/IIxnjI)xn 
> (IIxn, II/I 
IxII)b. But the latter sequence of 
vectors converges to zero. Thus t ?0. This, 
is a contradiction. 
9 The attainable set will also be bounded if (b.2)- 
(b.4) hold for the true production set, gross of govern- 
ment consumption, rather than the net production set, 
G. Thus the assumption that zero production is possible 
is not of great consequence.

DIAMOND AND MIRRLEES: OPTIMAL TAXATION 
23 
Finally, we should remark that the 
strong convexity assumption, (a.3), which 
was made in Theorem 1 can be changed to 
convexity without affecting the conclusion. 
All that is required is to replace the con- 
tinuous functions of the proof by upper 
semi-continuous correspondences. On the 
other hand, one can easily construct ex- 
amples in which an optimum fails to exist 
because of the absence of continuity. 
Efficiency 
The following lemma provides two cri- 
teria for optimal production to be on the 
frontier of the production set. It will be 
used to deduce a theorem about the case 
where household preferences are respected. 
LEMMA 1: Assume an optimum, q* , exists. 
If aggregate demand functions and the in- 
direct welfare function are continuous in the 
neighborhood of the optimal prices; and if 
either 
(1) for some i, V is a strictly increas- 
ing function of qi in the neighborhood 
of q*; or 
(2) for some i with q*>O, V is a 
strictly decreasing function of qi in the 
neighborhood of q*, 
then X(q*) is on thefrontier of G. 
PROOF: 
Let li be the vector with all zero com- 
ponents except the ith, which is one. In 
case 1, for E sufficiently small V(q*+E i) 
> V(q*). Hence X(q*+Eli) is not in G. 
Letting E decrease to zero, the continuity 
of X shows that X(q*) is a limit of points 
not in G, and therefore belongs to the 
boundary of G. In case 2, a similar argu- 
ment can be made using V(q* -Eli). 
These conditions are weak. They are, 
naturally, independent of production pos- 
sibilities. It may also be noticed that, when 
V is a differentiable function of prices, the 
stated conditions are equivalent to assum- 
ing that 
(29) 
It is not the case that V'(q*) ?- 0 
Here V'(q) is the vector of first derivatives 
of V with respect to prices. The equiva- 
lence of the conditions of the theorem and 
(29) is clear if we remember that 
(30) 
V'(q) q 
--ak= 
0, 
aqk 
since V is homogeneous of degree zero in q. 
Therefore V' <0 if and only if, 9V/Oqk=0 
when qk >0 and a V/aqk ? 0 in any case. 
In the following theorem, we strengthen 
the assumptions in a different way: they 
remain notably weak. 
THEOREM 
4. If (a.l)-(a.4) 
and (c.1) 
hold; if social welfare respects individual 
preferences; and if either 
(1) for some i, x < 
for all h, and 
x< O for some h'; or 
(2) for some i, with qi > 0, x4 > 0 for all 
h and x4>O for some h'; 
Then if an optimum exists, production for 
the optimum is on the frontier of the feasible 
set. 
PROOF: 
Individual demand functions are con- 
tinuous in the neighborhood of the opti- 
mum and thus aggregate demands and the 
indirect welfare function are continuous. 
Since social welfare respects preferences, 
indirect social welfare can be written as an 
increasing function of indirect utilities. In 
case 1, indirect utilities are a nondecreas- 
ing function of qi in the neighborhood of 
q* for all h while the indirect utility func- 
tion of h' is strictly increasing in qi. Thus 
V increases with qi. Case 2 follows simi- 
larly. 
The assumption of strictly convex pref- 
erences made in Theorem 4 is required in 
the theorem as stated. 
Example d: Consider an economy with one 
consumer whose indifference curves have

a linear section. Then the offer curve may 
coincide with the linear part of an indif- 
ference curve, giving a set of optima, only 
one of which is on the production frontier. 
As an illustration, see Figure 9. 
The example suggests that we weaken 
the conclusion of Theorem 4 to say that 
there exists an optimum on the frontier of 
G: this generalization is indeed correct if 
we merely assume convexity of preferences. 
The proof follows that of Theorem 4, with 
upper semi-continuity of the demand cor- 
respondence replacing continuity of de- 
mand functions. 
V. Extensions 
We can summarize the efficiency result 
by considering an economy with three 
sectors-consumers, 
private producers, 
public producers. We assumed that only 
the equilibrium position of the consumer 
sector enters the welfare function, and that 
only market transactions take place be- 
tween sectors, while the government has 
power to tax any intersector transaction 
at any desired rate. One conclusion was 
that all sectors not containing consumers 
should be viewed as a single sector, and 
treated so that aggregate production 
efficiency is achieved. By regrouping the 
parts of the economy according to this 
schematic division, we can extend the 
efficiency result to several other problems. 
In each case, we indicate briefly how ap- 
plication of this schematic view shows the 
relationship of the extension to the basic 
model. 
Intermediate Good Taxation 
The model, as presented above, left no 
scope for intermediate good taxation. If 
we separate private production possibili- 
ties into two (or many) sectors, we intro- 
duce the possibility of taxing transactions 
between firms. In the schematic view 
presented above, we could consider a con- 
sumer sector and two, constant returns to 
scale, private production sectors. We con- 
clude that we want efficiency for these 
private production possibilities taken to- 
gether. Therefore the optimal tax structure 
includes no intermediate good taxes, since 
these would prevent efficiency. (Similarly 
we conclude that government sales to firms 
should be untaxed while those to con- 
sumers are taxed.) 
There is a straightforward interpretation 
of this result, which helps to explain the 
desirability of production efficiency. In the 
absence of profits, taxation of intermediate 
goods must be reflected in changes in final 
good prices. Therefore, the revenue could 
have been collected by final good taxation, 
causing no greater change in final good 
prices and avoiding production ineffi- 
ciency. This interpretation highlights the 
necessity of our assumption of constant 
returns to scale in privately controlled 
production. 
However, it may well be desirable to tax 
transactions between consumers or to 
charge different taxes on producer sales to

25 
different consumers. There are two ways 
in which we can consider doing this. The 
country might be geographically parti- 
tioned with different consumer prices in 
different regions. Ignoring migration, and 
consumers making purchases in neighbor- 
ing regions, our analysis can be applied to 
determine taxes region by region. In gen- 
eral the tax structure will vary over the 
country. 
Alternatively, we might consider taxa- 
tion on all consumer-consumer transac- 
tions. Here, too, we would expect to be 
able to increase social welfare by having 
these additional tax controls. Neither addi- 
tion to the available tax structure alters 
the desirability of production efficiency. 
Untaxable Sectors 
One problem that arises with a model 
considering taxation of all transactions is 
that some transactions may not be taxable, 
practically or legally. An example of the 
former might be subsistence agriculture 
where transactions with consumers are 
hard to tax while those with firms are not. 
If the introduction of other taxes (e.g., 
on land or output) is ruled out, we can 
accommodate this problem in the model 
by including subsistence agriculture in the 
consumer rather than producer sector (or 
treating it as a second consumer sector). 
Efficiency would then be desired for the 
modern and government production sec- 
tors taken together; while the tax struc- 
ture rules would be stated in terms of de- 
mand derivatives of the augmented con- 
sumer sector rather than of just the true 
consumers. 
Similarly, in an economy without taxes, 
a public producer subject to a budget 
constraint is unable to charge different 
prices to consumers and producers. Lump- 
ing together the entire private sector as a 
single consumer sector, we obtain the con- 
ditions for optimal public production of an 
industry regulated in this manner. This 
is the problem considered by Boiteux in 
the context of costless income redistribu- 
tion. He also analyzed such an economy 
with several firms, each limited by a 
budget constraint. 
Foreigners 
It is not easy to provide a satisfactory 
welfare economics for a world of many 
countries. The study of world welfare 
maximization is interesting, and, one may 
hope, "relevant." But it has the serious 
limitation that its results can seldom be 
applied to the actions of governments. 
However altruistic the principles on which 
a government seeks to act, it has to allow 
for the actions other governments may 
take, based on different principles, or for 
different reasons. (A somewhat analogous 
problem arises in intertemporal welfare 
economics.) In the following two subsec- 
tions, we shall, in order to keep the dis- 
cussion brief, refer only to the case where 
the reactions of all other countries are 
well-defined functions of the actions of the 
country directly considered. Thus we 
neglect, reluctantly, those situations that 
have come to be called "game-theoretic." 
Also, we shall not consider the problem of 
formulating a social welfare function in an 
international setting. 
International Trade 
So long as we are completely indifferent 
to the welfare of the rest of the world, and 
so long as the reactions of other countries 
are well-defined, international trade simply 
provides us with additional possibilities for 
transforming some goods and services into 
others. The efficiency result then implies 
that we would want to equate marginal 
rates of transformation between producing 
and importing. If there is a monopoly 
position to be exploited, it should be. If 
international prices are unaffected by this 
country's demand, intermediate goods 
should not be subject to a tariff, but final

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
good sales direct to consumers should be 
subject to a tariff equal to the tax on the 
same sale by a domestic producer. 
Sometimes it is not possible to sell goods 
to foreigners at prices different from those 
at which they are sold to domestic con- 
sumers, although the theory just outlined 
suggests that foreigners should be treated 
like producers. As examples, we may cite 
tourists and commodities covered by spe- 
cial kinds of international agreement. If 
tourism, say, is an important 
trading 
opportunity for the country, and tourists 
have to be charged the same prices as 
domestic consumers, this will affect the 
optimal level of taxes on certain commodi- 
ties. The general efficiency result is not 
upset, however. The analysis can be per- 
formed by treating tourists as consumers 
whose income does not affect social wel- 
fare. 
The authors do not, of course, recom- 
mend indifference to the welfare of the 
rest of the world; although it happens to 
make the results somewhat neater. Inter- 
national trade provides the country with 
another set of consumers who can trade 
with it at prices different from its own 
consumers: the case (when foreign reac- 
tions are well-defined) is similar to the 
possibility 
of using different consumer 
prices in different regions of the same 
economy. In that case, there is no reason 
why optimal international 
trade prices 
should be the same as producer prices, p, 
or domestic consumer prices, q. 
Migration 
In all that has gone before, we have been 
holding constant the set of consumers in 
the economy. We can introduce migration 
in a straightforward manner. Social wel- 
fare may be a function of the consumption 
of every household in the world. Changes 
in the consumer prices charged in the 
home country cause migration in one direc- 
tion or another, and therefore affect wel- 
fare in ways we have not previously 
discussed (such as the effect on the in- 
habitants of another country of having 
additional taxpayers join them). But we 
can still define an indirect welfare func- 
tion V(q), so long as the reactions of the 
rest of the world are well-defined. Similarly 
we can define aggregate demand functions 
X(q), but these are no longer continuous. 
For, when a man decides to emigrate, his 
contribution to aggregate demand changes 
from xh to 0.10 But the number of migrants 
arising from a small price change may, 
quite reasonably, be assumed small rela- 
tive to the population as a whole. We can 
therefore 
adequately 
approximate 
this 
situation by considering a continuum of 
consumers. In this way we can restore 
continuity to aggregate demand, and to 
the indirect welfare function. It is to be 
expected, then, that production efficiency 
is still desired. Since the derivatives of the 
demand functions, and possibly also the 
derivatives of V, will be different when the 
possibility of migration is allowed for, the 
optimal tax structure will be changed to 
reflect the loss of tax revenue when net 
taxpayers, for example, leave the country. 
While we do not wish to examine this 
problem in detail here, we believe that 
these ideas provide an interesting 
ap- 
proach to the analysis. 
Consumnption 
Externalities 
The schematic view of this problem 
given above suggests that the basic struc- 
ture of the results, although not the specific 
optimal taxes, are unchanged by compli- 
cations which occur wholly within the 
consumer sector. Thus, if we introduce 
consumption externalities that leave ag- 
gregate demand continuous we will still 
obtain production efficiency at the opti- 
mum, if we can argue that V(q) has no 
unconstrained local maximum for finite q. 
10 A similar discontinuity problem arises in the case 
of tourists' decisions not to visit the counitry.

The conditions used above are no longer 
sufficient for this argument since the direct 
effects of a price change might be offset 
by the change in the pattern of externali- 
ties induced by the price change. Although 
we have not examined this case in detail, 
there are a number of cases where argu- 
ments similar to those in the no-externality 
case will be valid."1 Furthermore it seems 
quite likely to us that efficiency will be 
desired in realistic settings. 
Capital Market Imperfections 
While some capital market imperfec- 
tions affecting firms are complicated to 
deal with, some imperfections relevant 
only for consumers can be described as 
elements solely within the consumer sec- 
tor. For example, consider the constraint 
that consumers can lend but not borrow. 
We must then rewrite consumer utility 
maximization as subject to a set of budget 
constraints for the different time periods. 
In the case of two periods, for example, it 
would appear as 
Maximize u(xl, x2) 
(31) 
subject to qlxl + s ?0 
q2X2- 
s <O 
s?0O 
where s represents first period savings. 
From this consumer problem, we still have 
utility and demand expressible in terms of 
prices. We expect that the efficiency result 
continues to hold. In calculating the opti- 
mal formula, though, it becomes necessary 
to distinguish the time period of the good 
in question for there are now two Lagrange 
multipliers giving the marginal utility of 
income in each of the two periods. For this 
consumer we have 
av 
dOv 
(32) 
aXk 
- 
= - a xx 
dOqk 
aqk2 
Since savings are allowed a' > a2. If the 
consumer would borrow if he could, a' > a 2 
and the optimal tax structure is altered by 
this market limitation.
