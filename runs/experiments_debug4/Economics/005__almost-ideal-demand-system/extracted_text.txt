An Almost Ideal Demand System 
By ANGUS DEATON AND JOHN MUELLBAUER* 
Ever since Richard Stone (1954) first 
estimated a system of demand equations 
derived explicitly from consumer theory, 
there has been a continuing search for 
alternative specifications and functional 
forms. Many models have been proposed, 
but perhaps the most important in current 
use, apart from the original linear expendi- 
ture system, are the Rotterdam model (see 
Henri Theil, 1965, 1976; Anton Barten) and 
the translog model (see Laurits Christensen, 
Dale Jorgenson, and Lawrence Lau; Jorgen- 
son and Lau). Both of these models have 
been extensively estimated and have, in 
addition, been used to test the homogeneity 
and symmetry restrictions of demand the- 
ory. In this paper, we propose and estimate 
a new model which is of comparable gener- 
ality to the Rotterdam and translog models 
but which has considerable advantages over 
both. Our model, which we call the Almost 
Ideal Demand System (AIDS), gives an ar- 
bitrary first-order approximation to any de- 
mand system; it satisfies the axioms of 
choice exactly; it aggregates perfectly over 
consumers without invoking parallel linear 
Engel curves; it has a functional form which 
is consistent with known household-budget 
data; it is simple to estimate, largely avoid- 
ing the need for non-linear estimation; and 
it can be used to test the restrictions of 
homogeneity and symmetry through linear 
restrictions on fixed parameters. Although 
many of these desirable properties are 
possessed by one or other of the Rotterdam 
or translog models, neither possesses all of 
them simultaneously. 
In Section I of the paper, we discuss the 
theoretical specification of the AIDS and 
justify the claims in the previous paragraph. 
In Section II, the model is estimated on 
postwar British data and we use our results 
to test the homogeneity and symmetry re- 
strictions. Our results are consistent with 
earlier findings in that both sets of restric- 
tions are decisively rejected. We also find 
that imposition of homogeneity generates 
positive serial correlation in the errors of 
those equations which reject the restrictions 
most strongly; this suggests that the now 
standard rejection of homogeneity in de- 
mand analysis may be due to insufficient 
attention to the dynamic aspects of con- 
sumer behavior. Finally, in Section III, we 
offer a summary and conclusions. We be- 
lieve that the results of this paper suggest 
that the AIDS is to be recommended as a 
vehicle for testing, extending, and improving 
conventional demand analysis. This does 
not imply that the system, particularly in its 
simple static form, is to be regarded as a 
fully satisfactory explanation of consumers' 
behavior. Indeed, by proposing a demand 
system which is superior to its predecessors, 
we hope to be able to reveal more clearly 
the problems and potential solutions asso- 
ciated with the usual approach. 
I. Specification of the AIDS 
In much of the recent literature on sys- 
tems of demand equations, the starting 
point has been the specification of a func- 
tion which is general enough to act as a 
second-order approximation to any arbi- 
trary direct or indirect utility function or, 
more rarely, a cost function. For examples, 
see Christensen, Jorgenson, and Lau; W. 
Erwin Diewert (1971); or Ernst Berndt, 
Masako Darrough, and Diewert. Alterna- 
tively, it is possible to use a first-order 
approximation to the demand functions 
themselves as in the Rotterdam model, see 
Theil (1965, 1976); Barten. We shall follow 
these approaches in terms of generality but 
we start, not from some arbitrary preference 
*University of Bristol, andBirkbeck College, London, 
respectively. We are grateful to David Mitchell for help 
with the calculations and to Anton Barten, David 
He ndry, Claus Leser, Louis Phlips, and a referee for 
helpful comments on an earlier version.

ordering, but from a specific class of prefer- 
ences, which by the theorems of Muellbauer 
(1975, 1976) permit exact aggregation over 
consumers: the representation of market de- 
mands as if they were the outcome of deci- 
sions by a rational representative consumer. 
These preferences, known as the PIGLOG 
class, are represented via the cost or expendi- 
ture function which defines the minimum 
expenditure necessary to attain a specific 
utility level at given prices. We denote this 
function c(u,p) for utility u and price vector 
p, and define the PIGLOG class by 
(1) 
logc(u,p)=(1 
- u)log{a(p)} + ulog{b(p)} 
With some exceptions (see the Appendix), u 
lies between 0 (subsistence) and 1 (bliss) so 
that the positive linearly homogeneous func- 
tions a(p) and b(p) can be regarded as the 
costs of subsistence and bliss, respectively. 
The Appendix further discusses this general 
model as well as the implications of the 
underlying aggregation theory. 
Next we take specific functional forms for 
log a(p) and log b(p). For the resulting cost 
function to be a flexible functional form, it 
must possess enough parameters so that at 
any single point its derivatives ac/api, 
ac/au, 
a2c/apiapj, a2c/auapi, 
and a2c/au2 
can be set equal to those of an arbitrary cost 
function. We take

where ac, f3j, and y,J. are parameters. It can 
easily be checked that c(u,p) is linearly ho- 
mogeneous in p (as it must be to be a valid 
representation of preferences) provided that 
j21ai 1, 
l XYk*=Xki=Xf 
j=O 
It is also 
straightforward to check that (4) has enough 
parameters for it to be a flexible functional 
form provided it is borne in mind that, since 
utility is ordinal, we can always choose 
a normalization such that, at a point, 
a2logC/au2=0. 
The choice 
of the functions 
a(p) and b(p) in (2) and (3) is governed 
partly by the need for a flexible functional 
form. However, the main justification is that 
this particular choice leads to a system of 
demand functions with the desirable proper- 
ties which we demonstrate below. 
The demand functions can be derived di- 
rectly from equation (4). It is a fundamental 
property of the cost function (see Ronald 
Shephard, 1953, 1970, or Diewert's 1974 
survey paper) that its price derivatives are 
the quantities demanded: ac(u,p)/apj= q. 
Multiplying both sides by pi/c(u,p) we find 
(5) 
alogc(u,p) 
piqi 
alogp, = c(u,p) 
where wi is the budget share of good i. 
Hence, logarithmic differentiation of (4) 
gives the budget shares as a function of 
prices and utility:

For a utility-maximizing consumer, total 
expenditure x is equal to c(u,p) and this 
equality can be inverted to give u as a 
function of p and x, the indirect utility 
function. If we do this for (4) and substitute 
the result into (6) we have the budget shares 
as a function of p and x; these are the AIDS 
demand functions in budget share form:

Provided (10), (1 1), and (12) hold, equation 
(8) represents a system of demand functions 
which add up to total expenditure (Ewi = 1), 
are homogeneous of degree zero in prices 
and total expenditure 
taken together, 
and which satisfy Slutsky symmetry. Given 
these, the AIDS is simply interpreted: in the 
absence of changes in relative prices and 
"real" expenditure (x/P) 
the budget shares 
are constant and this is the natural starting 
point for predictions using the model. 
Changes in relative prices work through the 
terms yij; each yij represents 102 times the 
effect on the ith budget share of a 1 percent 
increase in the jth price with (x/P) 
held 
constant. Changes in real expenditure oper- 
ate through the /AR coefficients; these add to 
zero and are positive for luxuries and nega- 
tive for necessities. Further interpretation is 
best done in terms of the claims made in the 
introduction. 
A. Aggregation Over Households 
The aggregation theory developed in 
Muellbauer (1975, 1976, of which the main 
relevant points are summarized in the Ap- 
pendix) implies that exact aggregation is 
possible if, for an individual household h, 
behavior is described by the generalization 
of (8): 
(8') 
wih = ai + 
yij logpj + 3i log {x x/khP} 
The parameters kh can be interpreted as a 
sophisticated measure of household size 
which, in principle, could take account of 
age composition, other household character- 
istics, and economies of household size; and 
which is used to deflate the budget xh to 
bring it to a "needs corrected" per capita 
level. This allows a limited amount of taste 
variation across households. The share of 
aggregate expenditure on good i in the 
aggregate budget of all households, denoted 
iWFi 
is given by 
EPiqih 
Xh-E 
XhWib 
Xh 
h 
h 
which, when applied to (8') gives 
(8") 
- = ai + E y. logp1-/i log P 
+ YtEXh 
1?g(Xhl/kh 
)/E 
Xh} 
Define the aggregate index k by 
(13) 
log(x/k)= 
E xhlog(xhlkh 
/ xh 
h 
where x is the average level of total expendi- 
ture Xh. Hence (8") becomes 
(8"') iw i=ai+ ' 
y,ylogpj+,8ilog(xi/kP) 
i 
This is identical in form to (8') and this 
confirms that under these assumptions ag- 
gregate budget shares correspond to the de- 
cisions of a rational representative house- 
hold whose preferences are given by the 
AIDS cost function (4) and whose budget is 
given by x-/k, the "representative budget 
level." 
The index k has an interesting interpreta- 
tion. If each household had the same tastes 
(kh= 1, all h), k would be an index of the 


--- Page 4 ---

315 
equality of the distribution of household 
budgets. In fact, this index is identical to 
Theil's (1972) entropy measure of equality Z 
deflated by the number of households H, 
where logZ=-X(xh/X)log(xh/X) 
and X 
is the aggregate budget; Z reaches its maxi- 
mum level of H when there is perfect equal- 
ity so that Xh = x, all h. Therefore as inequal- 
ity increases, k = Z/ H decreases and the 
representative budget level increases. When 
kh differs across households, for example, 
because of differences in household com- 
position, the index k reflects not only the 
distribution of budgets but the demographic 
structure. Ideally, one might attempt to 
model the variation of kh with household 
characteristics in a cross-section study and, 
given time-series data on the joint distribu- 
tion of household budgets and characteris- 
tics, construct a series for k for use in fitting 
(8"'). Data limitations have prevented us 
from carrying out this proposal in the em- 
pirical application below. To the extent that 
k is constant or uncorrelated with x orp, no 
omitted variable bias arises from our proce- 
dure of omitting k and redefining a!* = ai - 
A log k* where k* is the constant or sample 
mean value of k. 
When the distribution of household bud- 
gets and household characteristics is invar- 
iant except for equiproportional changes in 
household budgets, k is constant. In this 
case there is considerable extra scope for 
taste variations in the individual demand 
functions without altering the validity of 
the representative consumer hypothesis em- 
bodied in (8"'). Indeed, it turns out that not 
only aih, all i, but also yij, all i,j, can differ 
over households. The ai and y. parameters 
in (8"') are then weighted averages of the 
micro parameters. 
B. Generality of the Model 
The flexible functional form property of 
the AIDS cost function implies that the 
demand functions derived from it are first- 
order approximations to any set of demand 
functions derived from utility-maximizing 
behavior. The AIDS is thus as general as 
other flexible forms such as the translog or 
the Rotterdam models. However, if maxi- 
mizing behavior is not assumed but it is 
simply held that demands are continuous 
functions of the budget and of prices, then 
the AIDS demand functions (8) (without 
the restrictions (11) and (12)) can still pro- 
vide a first-order approximation. In general, 
without maximizing assumptions, we can 
think of the budget shares wi as being un- 
known functions of logp and logx. From 
(8) and (9), the AIDS 
has derivatives 
awi/alogx=A/3 and awi/alogp1=y -- 8- 
AfE Yjk logPk so that, at any point, f and 
y can be chosen so that the derivatives of 
the AIDS will be identical to those of any 
true model. Given that the a parameters act 
as intercepts, the AIDS can thus provide a 
local first-order approximation to any true 
demand system, whether derived from the 
theory of choice or not. This property is 
important since it means that tests of homo- 
geneity of symmetry are set within a main- 
tained hypothesis which makes sense and 
would be widely accepted in its own right. 
Generality is not without its problems, 
however. There is a large number of param- 
eters in (18) and on most data sets these are 
unlikely to be all well determined. It is thus 
important that there should exist some 
straightforward procedure for eliminating 
unnecessary parameters without untoward 
consequences for the properties of the 
model. In the AIDS, this can be done by 
placing whatever restrictions on yij parame- 
ters are thought to be empirically or theor- 
etically plausible. As we shall see below, in 
many cases it will be possible to impose 
these restrictions on a single equation basis. 
One obvious restriction is that for some 
pairs (i,j),-y, should be zero; for such pairs 
the budget share of each is independent of 
the price of the other if (x/P) 
is held con- 
stant. It can be shown that yij has approxi- 
mately the same sign as the compensated 
cross-price elasticity and this is also useful 
in suggesting prior restrictions. We should 
not however expect all the y,,s to be zero; 
the resulting model, wi = ai + A9log(x/P) is 
extremely restrictive and has been tested 
and rejected by Deaton (1978).

C. Restrictions 
If we start from equations (8) and (9) as 
our maintained hypothesis, we can examine 
the effects of the restrictions (10)-(12) 
which are required to make the model con- 
sistent with the theory of demand. The con- 
ditions (10) are the adding-up restrictions; as 
can easily be checked from (8), these ensure 
that I wi=1. Homogeneity of the demand 
functions requires restriction (1 1) which can 
be tested equation by equation. Slutsky sym- 
metry is satisfied by (8) if and only if the 
symmetry restriction (12) holds. As is true of 
other flexible functional forms, negativity 
cannot be ensured by any restrictions on 
the parameters alone. It can however be 
checked for any given estimates by calculat- 
ing the eigenvalues of the Slutsky matrix sY, 
say. In practice, it is easier to use not sij but 
kij =pjpjsij/x, the eigenvalues of which have 
the same signs as those of s.f and which are 
given by 
(14) 
kij = Yy +,O3,Oj 
log p- Wia8 + W.Wj 
where Sij is the Kronecker delta. Note that 
apart from this negativity condition, all the 
restrictions are expressible as linear con- 
straints involving only the parameters and 
so can be imposed globally by standard 
techniques. 
D. Estimation 
In general, estimation can be carried out 
by substituting (9) in (8) to give

and estimating this non-linear system of 
equations by maximum likelihood or other 
methods with and without the restrictions 
(11) and (12). (Note that since the data add 
up by construction, (10) is not testable.) 
Equation (15) is not particularly difficult to 
estimate since the first-order conditions for 
likelihood maximization are linear in a and 
y given f3 and vice versa so that "concentra- 
tion" allows iteration on a subset of the 
parameters (see for example, Deaton, 1975, 
pp. 46-49). Although all the parameters in 
(15) are identified given sufficient variation 
in the independent variables, in many exam- 
ples the practical identification of a0 is 
likely to be problematical. This parameter is 
only identified from the ais in (15) by the 
presence of these latter inside the term in 
braces, originally in the formula for log P, 
equation (9). However, in situations where 
individual prices are closely collinear, log P 
is unlikely to be very sensitive to its weights 
so that changes in the intercept term in (15) 
due to variations in a0 can be offset in the 
as with minimal effect on log P. This can be 
overcome in practice by assigning a value to 
a0 a priori. Since the parameter can be inter- 
preted as the outlay required for a minimal 
standard of living when prices are unity 
(usually in the base year; see the Appendix), 
choosing a plausible value is not difficult. 
However, in many situations, it is possible 
to exploit the collinearity of the prices to 
yield a much simpler estimation technique. 
Note from (8) that if P were known, the 
model would be linear in the parameters a, 
,/, and y, and estimation (at least without 
cross-equation restrictions such as symme- 
try) can be done equation by equation by 
OLS which, in this case and given normally 
distributed errors, is equivalent to maximum 
likelihood estimation for the system as a 
whole. The adding-up constraints (10) will 
be automatically satisfied by these esti- 
mates. In situations where prices are closely 
collinear, it may well be adequate to ap- 
proximate P as proportional to some known 
index P*, say. One obvious candidate in 
view of (8) and (9) is Stone's (1953) index 
logP*=1Wk 
Ogpk. If Pz0P* 
say, then (8) 
can be estimated as 
(16) 
wi = (ai - A log0) + E YlogPj+Alog 
px) 
Note that in this framework the ai parame- 
ters are identified only up to a scalar multi- 
ple of /Ak; if we write ai =ai- A3 logp, it is 


--- Page 6 ---
VOL. 70 NO. 3 
DEA TON AND MUELLBA UER: IDEAL DEMAND SYSTEM 
317 
easily seen that 
a = 0 is still required for 
adding up, since E 8, = 0. 
In the empirical results below we shall 
estimate both (15) and (16), and show that 
the latter is an excellent approximation to 
the former. However, it must be emphasized 
that (16) exists only as an approxima- 
tion to (15) and will only be accurate in 
specific circumstances, albeit widely occur- 
ring ones in time-series estimation. Note 
finally that if single equation estimation is 
used 
to investigate 
likely 
restrictions 
amongst the y parameters, as is suggested in 
Part B above, the constrained OLS estimates 
will no longer automatically be maximum 
likelihood, efficient, or satisfy adding up. 
Hence, once the restrictions have been 
selected, (15) should be used to reestimate 
the whole system. 
E. Relationship with Budget Studies and 
with the Rotterdam Model 
The Engel curves corresponding to (8) 
take the form piqi= ix+f3Axlogx for ap- 
propriate functions of prices (i. These are 
clearly not linear except in the proportional 
case when A3i=0. The model thus allows a 
possible reconciliation between time-series 
models, which have to date required linear- 
ity of Engel curves for aggregation with 
cross-section results, which typically find 
evidence of nonlinearity. Indeed, the PIG- 
LOG Engel curve wi = ti+ A log x was used 
as early as 1943 by Holbrook Working and 
has recently been recommended by Claus 
Leser (1963, 1976) as providing an excellent 
fit to cross-section data in a wide range of 
circumstances. 
In the time-series context, the AIDS has a 
close relationship to the Rotterdam model 
of Theil (1965, 1976) and Barten. The first 
difference form of (8) is 
(17) Awi= AAlogt 
x + E-y.jAlgpj 
which no longer involves the a parameters 
except through AlogP. This dependence can 
be seen by writing (17) in full, i.e., 
(18) 
A?wiw=Ai Alogx- 
E akA4logPk 
k 
2 E X YkjA(logPjlogpk) + z y/i logpj 
2k 
j 
J 
Again, all the parameters (except ao) are 
theoretically identified, but in practice the 
substitutability between y..s and f3-a1s in fit- 
ting (18) if prices are nearly collinear means 
that, in such cases, the only practical way of 
estimating (17) is to replace AlogP by some 
index, for example, A(Y Wklogpk) 
as before 
or by its approximation ZWkAlogpk. 
In the 
latter case, the right-hand side of (17) be- 
comes identical to the right-hand side of the 
Rotterdam model which is 
(19) 
wit?ogqi = bA{?Aogx - XWkAo9gPk) 
+ E CijA Jogpj 
The dependent variable is different in the 
AIDS; instead of wiAlogqi we have Awi or 
wiAlogwi. Thus, by replacing the dependent 
variable wiAlog q in the Rotterdam model 
by wiAlogwi, an addition of wiAlog(pi/x), 
we generate the first-difference form of the 
AIDS. The similarity between the two mod- 
els is quite striking in this form; both are 
effectively linear and both can be used to 
test homogeneity and symmetry with only 
linear restrictions on constant parameters. 
Note however that the parameters have 
quite different interpretations in the two 
models so that, for example, the negativity 
condition applies directly to the matrix of 
price effects in the Rotterdam model which 
is not the case for the AIDS. The crucial 
difference between the two models is that 
(17), unlike (19), is derived from explicit 
demand functions, (8), and an explicit char- 
acterization of preferences, (4). For the pre- 
diction of demand this difference may not 
be vitally important, but in many other con- 
texts, for example in calculating cost-of- 
living indices, household equivalence scales, 
or optimal tax rates, the ability to link

estimated parameter values to preferences 
themselves becomes of great significance. 
II. An Application to Postwar British Data 
In this section we estimate the model 
using annual British data from 1954 to 1974 
inclusive on eight nondurable groups of 
consumers' expenditure, 
namely, 
food, 
clothing, housing services, fuel, drink and 
tobacco, 
transport and communication 
services, other goods, and other services. As 
discussed in Section I, Part A above, if we 
assume that the index k in (8"') is either 
constant or that its deviations are indepen- 
dently distributed from those of the average 
budget x- and of prices, no biases result from 
its omission. In particular, we allow the in- 
tercepts in (8"') to absorb the - fA log k 
terms. We then proceed by first following 
the strategy outlined in Section I, Part D, 
setting logP* 
= X Wk logpk for each year and 
estimating equation (16) for each good sep- 
arately by OLS. The system is then reesti- 
mated, equation by equation, and again 
using P*, in order to test the homogeneity 
condition. Equation (11) is imposed by sub- 
stitution so that instead of (16), we estimate 
(20) wi = a,* + 2- Yijlog( P) + Aiog( p*J) 
At this stage, F-ratios are calculated equa- 
tion by equation to test the validity of the 
restriction. 
The next stage is to impose symmetry of 
y, at this point replacing P* by the "correct" 
price index (9) with ao set to some ap- 
propriate value. Since symmetry, unlike 
homogeneity or the unrestricted model, 
involves cross-equation restrictions, the vari- 
ance-covariance matrix of the residuals for 
the first time plays a part in the estimation. 
Since this is unknown a priori, normal prac- 
tice would be to replace it by its maximum 
likelihood estimate. However, with only 
twenty-one observations, this is not practi- 
cable for equation (15) since, with so many 
parameters in each equation, the likelihood 
can be made arbitrarily large by making any 
one equation fit perfectly. ' This difficulty 
can only be resolved by assuming a particu- 
lar structure for the variance-covariance 
matrix of the residuals. Following Deaton 
(1975, p. 39), we assume V= a2(I- 
ii'), 
where V is the variance-covariance matrix 
of the residuals, a2 is a (positive) parameter 
to be estimated, I is an n x n identity matrix 
and i is a vector each of the elements of 
which is (n)- 1/2. In this case, maximum-like- 
lihood estimation reduces to least squares so 
that instead of minimizing the determinant 
of the matrix of residual cross products, we 
minimize its trace. The likelihood values 
quoted below are calculated on this assump- 
tion. Once again, maximum use is made of 
substitution in the estimation so that, under 
symmetry, (15) is estimated using only the 
fourteen independent ai*s and A3is and the 
twenty-eight parameters forming the upper 
right-hand triangle of y with its final row 
and column deleted. We now check that P* 
and P are sufficiently close to allow com- 
parison of likelihoods both by direct evalua- 
tion of both indices and by reestimation of 
the unrestricted and homogeneous models 
using P as evaluated from the symmetric 
estimates. It is also possible to check con- 
cavity at this stage by using the symmetric 
parameter estimates to calculate the eigen- 
values of the matrix in (14). Finally, the 
whole process is repeated with the model 
written in first differences, that is, equation 
(17) with the addition of intercepts. Collin- 
earity prevented any successful attempt to 
link P to the parameter estimates in these 
regressions; instead, the value of P calcu- 
lated from the symmetric estimation in 
levels was used throughout. 
Note that we choose to test symmetry 
whether or not homogeneity is rejected. This 
procedure has been criticized by Grayham 
Mizon who suggests that optimal inference 
requires that further testing be abandoned 
as soon as a rejection is encountered. 
Mizon's criticism would be correct if we 
were certain of our maintained hypothesis, 
but to some extent this is a matter of choice. 
Many economists would choose not to test

homogeneity, treating absence of money 
illusion as a maintained hypothesis; the test 
of symmetry would then be the interesting 
one. Even if the maintained hypothesis 
turns out to be false, tests based on it are 
not necessarily without interest. Few if any 
tests in econometrics are carried out within 
the framework of maintained hypotheses 
which are even widely accepted, let alone of 
unchallengeable validity. 
Table 1 reports the first-stage estimates of 
(16) using P* and without any constraints 
on the parameters save (10) which are auto- 
matically and costlessly satisfied. The esti- 
mates of /8 classify food and housing 
as necessities while the other goods are 
luxuries. A large number of y coefficients 
are significantly different from zero; twenty- 
two out of sixty-four have t-values ab- 
solutely larger than 2. Even so, none of the 
variables considered have any detectable 
effect on the value share for fuel and very 
few have influence in the other goods 
or other services equations. Similarly, the 
prices of fuel, of transport and communica- 
tion, and of other services have little or no 
effect anywhere (except, of course, through 
P* and the value share itself), while the 
prices of food, drink and tobacco, and of 
other services appear with considerable reg- 
ularity. The total expenditure and own-price 
elasticities are shown in the first two col- 
umns of Table 2 and, although food has an 
(insignificant) positive price elasticity, these 
numbers appear both credible and in line 
with other studies. Note the general price 
inelasticity of demand; only transport and 
communication appear to be price elastic. 
Table 1 also shows, in the column headed 
yzij, the row sums of the unconstrained Yij 
matrix; this number shows 102 times the 
absolute effect on each value share of a 1 
percent increase in all prices and total ex- 
penditure. Under homogeneity, this should 
be zero and the bracketed numbers given 
are t-tests of the significance of the devia- 
tion from zero. These numbers are, of 
course, identical to the square roots of the 
F-ratios obtained by comparing the residual 
sums of squares of equations (16) and (20). 
Hence, a proportional increase in prices and 
expenditure will decrease expenditure on 
food and on clothing, and increase expendi- 
ture on housing and transport and com- 
munication. These are also the commodities 
for which the elasticities suffer the largest 
changes between columns 1 and 2 and col- 
umns 3 and 4 of Table 2. Other deviations 
from homogeneity appear not to be signifi- 
cant. The final columns of Table 1 give 
equations standard errors, the R 2 and 
Durbin-Watson (D. W.) statistics for free 
and restricted estimation. Note that for the 
four commodity groups where homogeneity

is rejected, the D. W. statistic shows a sharp 
fall in each case. 
The failure of homogeneity is not a new 
result (see, for example, Barten; Ray Byron; 
Deaton, 1974a), and can be ascribed to a 
number of possible causes. However, as far 
as we are aware, the introduction of serial 
correlation through the imposition of homo- 
geneity is a result which has not been previ- 
ously remarked, although it may have been 
implicit in earlier work. There are a num- 
ber of plausible explanations for this phe- 
nomenon. For example, expenditure on 
several items may be relatively inflexible in 
the short run; housing is the obvious case 
here. The explanation of such items may 
require other variables such as stocks, 
lagged dependent variables, or time trends 
which can perhaps be proxied by the ab- 
solute price level. The omission of such vari- 
ables will thus lead to a rejection of homo- 
geneity associated with an introduction of 
serial correlation in the residuals of the re- 
stricted equations. In principle one could 
easily include such conditioning variables in 
the AIDS cost function, for example by 
allowing the as to vary linearly with them, 
and this is likely to be an important topic 
for future research. A second explanation is 
the omission of price expectations-the 
argument advanced by Deaton (1977a) 
would suggest that factors such as the 
frequency of purchase for different goods 
will be relevant in assessing the response of 
expenditures to changes in price, especially 
when there is rapid relative or absolute price 
change. A third possibility, suggested by the 
discussion of aggregation in Section I, Part 
A above, is that it may be incorrect to 
assume that k, the index reflecting the dis- 
tribution of household budgets and demo- 
graphic structure, is independent of the 
average budget and the price vector. 
Finally, the assumption of weak intertempo- 
ral separability of nondurable goods in the 
intertemporal utility function, which is 
required to justify the conventional static 
utility-maximizing model, may be inap- 
propriate. It is not difficult to construct 
other models which produce the result and 
without extensive further empirical work it 
is extremely difficult to discriminate be- 
tween them. 
In moving to the symmetric estimates (not 
reported here), in which P* is replaced by P, 
we must first check the closeness of the 
approximation. Table 3 reproduces the two 
series, P* = exp{ Wk logpk } and P scaled to 
be unity in the base year, i.e., exp{ 
ak logPk 
+ 2 
Ykj logpklogpj} evaluated at the sym- 
metric parameter estimates. Both series are 
based on unity in 1970. Clearly the dif- 
ferences are small; the absolute magnitude 
of the difference is never greater than .008. 
The reestimation of the unconstrained 
and homogeneous models using P rather 
than P* confirmed the empirical unimpor- 
tance of the difference. Both sets of likeli- 
hoods are given in Table 4. It must be 
reemphasized that these findings are condi- 
tional on the kind of relative price move- 
ments that took place in our sample. How- 
ever, even if relative price changes had been 
greater, the results suggest that the proce-

dure of starting with P*, calculating OLS 
regressions, computing a new P, and repeat- 
ing will be a computationally efficient way 
of obtaining good estimates of the full non- 
linear system. 
Symmetry, unlike homogeneity, cannot be 
tested on an equation-by-equation basis and 
we must rely on a large-sample likelihood- 
ratio test for the system as a whole. For 
comparison, twice the logarithm of the like- 
lihood is 1722.5 for the unconstrained sys- 
tem, 1579.6 for the homogeneous model (a 
fall which reflects the individual restrictions) 
and this falls further to 1491.0 under sym- 
metry. Since symmetry embodies twenty- 
one constraints over and above the seven of 
homogeneity, the restriction is rejected on 
an asymptotically valid X2-test whether or 
not the maintained hypothesis is taken to 
contain homogeneity. Once again, this is 
consistent with earlier results although rejec- 
tion of symmetry given homogeneity is not 
always clear-cut in the studies cited above. 
The interpretation of the rejection is not 
clear without some convincing explanation 
of the lack of homogeneity. Without this, it 
is impossible to know whether or not we 
should expect symmetry to hold. For exam- 
ple, it is possible to introduce habits into 
demand functions so that, if they are 
allowed for, symmetry can be expected to 
hold, while if ignored, symmetry will be 
destroyed. 
The full set of symmetric parameter 
estimates are not included here for reasons 
of space. The most interesting property of 
these, apart from symmetry, is in their im- 
plications for negativity. To assess this, the 
K matrix of equation (14) was evaluated for 
each year in the sample and its eigenvalues 
calculated. One of these is identically zero 
and, for concavity, the others should be 
negative. Contrary to this, we found one 
positive eigenvalue for the early part of the 
period, increasing to two by the end. The 
most obvious symptom of nonconcavity in 
the symmetric estimates was an estimated 
positive compensated own-price elasticity 
for fuel throughout the sample period. This 
may seem to be of limited importance given 
that the symmetric homogeneous model has 
already been rejected; if the cost function 
doesn't exist, why worry about its concav- 
ity? However, for several reasons it would 
be extremely useful to have parameter 
estimates for a reasonably general concave

homogeneous cost function. For example, 
we frequently wish to calculate price and 
quantity index numbers or to use optimal 
taxation formulae to derive numerical val- 
ues for tax rates. All such calculations re- 
quire numerical estimates of cost functions 
and, if they are to make any sense at all, 
these cost functions must be both homoge- 
neous and concave. Consequently, in cases 
where empirical estimates of demand equa- 
tions have been used in applied welfare 
analysis, the linear expenditure system 
has invariably been used; see, for exam- 
ple, Anthony Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz, 
Muellbauer (1974), or Deaton (1977b). With 
the linear expenditure system, the model is 
so restrictive that concavity of the cost func- 
tion is virtually guaranteed provided inferior 
goods do not appear. But this restrictiveness 
is also known to be empirically false (see, 
for example, Deaton, 1974b or 1978) so that 
it would be of considerable value to have 
estimates of a concave cost function which 
allowed considerably more substitution than 
does the linear expenditure system. Conse- 
quently, it will be of considerable interest in 
future work to attempt to restrict the param- 
eters further so that the estimated cost func- 
tion is concave. 
Finally, we turn to the estimation of the 
model in first-difference form. Here we use 
equation (17) plus intercepts, i.e., 
(21) 
Awi = 71i + iAlog( p ) + 2 
Yik AlogPk 
k 
where the constants qi are introduced pri- 
marily for econometric reasons but, if sig- 
nificant, would imply time trends in the 
original model which expresses the variables 
in levels. The P is taken as in Table 3. In 
these regressions homogeneity is only re- 
jected for food and for transport and com- 
munication; clothing and housing, which 
rejected homogeneity in the earlier re- 
gressions, now yield insignificant F-ratios. 
Closer inspection reveals that for both these 
cases, the constant term qi, which is insigni- 
ficant without constraints, becomes signifi- 
cant when homogeneity is imposed. Simi- 
larly, for transport and communication mi 
becomes significant when homogeneity is 
imposed, but in this case the F-ratio remains 
significant. This would support our earlier 
conjectures as to the possible role of time 
trends, stocks, or other omitted variables in 
explaining nonhomogeneity. Likewise, in 
Table 2 the expenditure elasticities from the 
first-difference model tend to be higher than 
the levels estimates when stock effects are 
likely to be important (clothing, other 
goods) and lower when one would expect 
short-run total expenditure effects to be 
limited (food, housing, transport). Other- 
wise, the first-difference parameter esti- 
mates, homogeneous or unconstrained, are 
rather close to the values originally ob- 
tained. As with levels, tests of concavity 
with the first-difference model revealed 
several violations. The likelihoods for the 
two models are summarized in Table 4; the 
fact that homogeneity cannot be rejected 
overall at the 5 percent level reflects the 
importance of the time trends in the hous- 
ing, clothing, and transport and communi- 
cation equations. Note too that in this case, 
from the last column of the table, symmetry 
is only just rejected given homogeneity. 
Hence, if we make some allowance for the 
asymptotic nature of the test, these final 
results would suggest that the introduction 
of (arbitrary) time trends removes much of 
the conflict between the data and the hy- 
pothesis of a representative consumer maxi- 
mizing a conventional static utility function. 
III. Summary and Conclusions 
In this paper we have introduced a new 
system of demand equations, the AIDS, in 
which the budget shares of the various com- 
modities are linearly related to the loga- 
rithm of real total expenditure and the loga- 
rithms of relative prices. The model is 
shown to possess most of the properties 
usually thought desirable in conventional 
demand analysis, and to do so in a way not 
matched by any single competing system. 
Fitted to postwar British data, the AIDS is 
capable of explaining a high proportion of 
the variance of the commodity budget 
shares but, unless allowance is made for 
omitted variables by the arbitrary use of

323 
time trends, does so in a way which is 
inconsistent with the hypothesis of con- 
sumers making decisions according to the 
model's demand functions governed by the 
conventional static budget constraint. These 
results suggest that influences other than 
current prices and current total expenditure 
must be systematically modelled if even the 
broad pattern of demand is to be explained 
in a theoretically coherent and empirically 
robust way. Whether these developments 
generalize the static framework by including 
stock effects, errors in price perceptions, or 
by going beyond the assumption of weak 
intertemporal separability on which the 
static model rests, we believe that the AIDS, 
with its simplicity of structure, generality, 
and conformity with the theory, offers a 
platform on which such developments can 
proceed. 
APPENDIX: AIDS IN THE CONTEXT 
OF AGGREGATION THEORY 
In Muellbauer (1975, 1976), a definition 
of the existence conditions for a representa- 
tive consumer is given which allows more 
general behavior than the parallel linear En- 
gel curves which are required if average 
demands are to be a function of the average 
budget. We know that in general, the 
average budget share 
Wi 
E pqiqh/ E Xh 
E XhWh/ E Xh 
h 
h 
h 
h 
is a function of prices and the complete 
distribution vector (xl,x2, ... , xH). A repre- 
sentative consumer exists in Muellbauer's 
sense if each jij can be written as a function 
of prices and the same single scalar xo, itself 
a function of prices and the distribution 
vector. This scalar, which can be thought of 
as marking a position in the distribution 
of xs, is the representative budget level. 
Muellbauer shows that for an xo to exist 
such that 
(Al) 
E XhWih(Xh,p)/Xh 
= Wi{XO(X1' 
... 
XH,P),P} 
h 
the individual budget share equations must 
have the "generalized linear" (GL) form: 
(A2) 
Wih(XhIP) 
= Vh(Xh,p)Ai(p) 
+ Bi(p) + Cih(p) 
where Vh, Ai,Bi, and Cih are functions satis- 
fying XiAj=XiCih=X-hCih=O 
and EBi=l. 
Clearly, (Al) goes beyond the usual for- 
mulation of xo = xE, and, as we shall see 
below, allows us to incorporate into the 
demand functions features of the expendi- 
ture distribution other than the mean. 
Of particular interest is the case where xo 
is independent of prices, depending only on 
the individual xs. This occurs if, and only if, 
the vh function in (A2) restricts to 
(A3) vh(xh,p) ={ 1-(xh/kh) 
a} 
where a is a constant and kh, although not a 
function of Xh, and p is free to vary from 
household to household. In this case, the 
budget shares are said to have the "price-in- 
dependent generalized linear" form (PIGL). 
Note the special case of (A3) as a->O, i.e., 
(A4) 
Vh(Xh,P) = log(Xh / kh) 
For obvious reasons, this is referred to as 
the PIGLOG case. By substituting (A3) in 
(A2), (A1) can be used to give an explicit 
form for xo, viz., 
(A5) 
x 
{ 
X)a 
Xhy/ 
( 
(kh)/ 
) 
If we assume that individual behavior is 
preference consistent, the cost function cor- 
responding to PIGL takes the form 
(A6) 
{c(uh,p)/kh } 
= (1- 
uh){ a(p)} 
+ Uh{ b(p) } 
which as a tends to zero takes the PIGLOG 
form 
(A7) 
log{ c(uh,p)/kh} 
= ( -uh)log{ a(p)} + uhlog{ b(p)} 
where a(p) and b(p) are linear homoge- 
neous concave functions, a is the constant

parameter of (A3), and (with some excep- 
tions discussed below) 0 <u < 1. The quan- 
tity kh can be used to allow for family 
composition effects within PIGL; for the 
standard or "reference" household kh is 
unity. 
Since the AIDS is a member of the PIG- 
LOG family, and hence of PIGL, we can 
achieve maximum generality by discussing 
some of the important properties of this 
class. If, omitting the household subscript, 
we write q* for the quantity demanded of 
good i, then, by the derivative property of 
the cost function, q = ac1pj so that wi = 
p,q,/x = alogc/alogpj. 
Hence from (A6), 
taking kh= 1, and differentiating 
(A8) 
ac a alog c= aa aai( -1u) + uab abi 
a logp1 
where a,=aloga/1logpj 
and b1=alogb/ 
a logpi. Hence, substituting x for c, 
( 
) 
i 
( 
)( x )i 
(x 
)i 
where, from (A6), u=(xa- 
aa)/(ba- 
aa) 
or from (A7), u=(logx-loga)/(logb- 
log a). Similarly, when a = 0, 
(AIO) 
wi= (I -u)a + ubi 
Equations (A9) and (A10) have attractive 
interpretations. Cost c(u,p) is increasing in 
utility as long as b(p) is greater than 
a(p)-note 
that this does not depend on the 
sign of a-so 
that as u increases from 0 to 
1, c(u,p) increases from a(p) to b(p) with wi 
moving from ai to bi. Hence a total expendi- 
ture of a(p) can be thought of as "poverty" 
expenditure with associated expenditure 
pattern ai, while b(p) is "affluence" ex- 
penditure with budget shares bi. On this 
interpretation x = a(p) and x = b(p) are the 
equations of the tangents to the poverty 
and affluence indifference curves, respec- 
tively, u = 0 and u = 1. From (A6) therefore, 
we see that the tangent to the indifference 
curve actually attained is the mean of order 
a of poverty and affluence tangents, the 
weights depending on the welfare level or 
outlay of the household. This averaging is 
even more obvious in the value share equa- 
tions (A9) and (A 10). Since (1 - u)(a/x)a 
and u(b/x)a sum to unity, as do (1- u) and 
u, these equations give the actual budget 
shares as weighted averages of ai and bi. 
Since the value shares of luxuries increase 
with total outlay and hence with u, we can 
characterize luxuries and necessities simply 
by whether bi is greater than or less than ai. 
Inferior goods are not excluded under PIGL 
and it is straightforward to construct exam- 
ples from both (A9) and (AIO). 
Note finally that there are restrictions on 
the possible set of x and p over which the 
cost function and the associated demands 
are valid. One set of restrictions is implied 
by the necessity that, for all i, 0 < wi < 1. The 
upper bound is relevant when bi >ai and 
implies that u = (xa - aa)/(ba 
- aa) < 
min{I 
- ai(a/x)a }/ {(b/x)bi 
- (a/x)aia}]. 
The lower bound, relevant when bi <ai re- 
quires similarly that u = (x a 
a)/(b 
aa) 
> maxj[(a/x)aa1/{(a/x)a/x 
- (b/x)abi}]. 
The second set of restrictions are those re- 
quired to ensure that the cost function is 
concave. From (A6), we can see that a 
sufficient condition for concavity of c(u,p) is 
that a(p) and b(p) be concave and that 
0 < u < 1. However, this is by no means nec- 
essary. If b(p) is "more concave" than a(p), 
then c(u,p) is concave for u >0 and for a 
range of u > 1. It can be shown that the 
PIGL cost function is concave for all x > 0, 
p > 0 if and only if ai = bi for all i, and a(p) 
and b(p) are concave. In this not very inter- 
esting case, preferences are homothetic. 
The practical application of the PIGL 
class requires selection of specific functional 
forms for the functions a(p) and b(p); those 
leading to the AIDS have been discussed in 
the text. However, the PIGL class is related 
to two other well-known models. Note first 
that if a = 1, and kh= 1, (A6) becomes the 
Gorman polar form. The PIGL class thus 
includes all models with linear Engel curves, 
for example, linear expenditure system, the 
quadratic utility function, as special cases. 
Perhaps less obviously, a weakly restricted 
form of the indirect translog is also PIG- 
LOG. From Jorgenson and Lau the translog

where we can choose 
= - 1 and /i3 = 
as arbitrary normalizations. Write Ek/ki= 
/8Mi, then if we impose the additional restric- 
tion that Xi/Mi = 0, (Al 1) solves explicity 
for log c(u,p) to 
(A12) 
logc(u,p)

This is of the general form log c(u,p)= 
log a(p) + u/log h(p) for appropriate choice 
of a(p) 
and h(p). 
Using 
log h(p) = 
l/log{b(p)/a(p)} 
to define b(p) and sub- 
stituting, we see that (A12) is identical to 
(A7). Hence, in this case (X i/8mi = 0) and in 
this case only, the indirect translog allows 
consistent aggregation. No such result holds 
for any interesting subcase of the direct 
translog.
