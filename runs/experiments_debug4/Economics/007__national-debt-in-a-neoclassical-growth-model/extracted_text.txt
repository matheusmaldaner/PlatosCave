NATIONAL 
DEBT IN A NEOCLASSICAL 
GROWTH MODEL 
By PETER A. DIAMOND* 
This paper contains a model designed to serve two purposes, to 
examine long-run competitive equilibrium in a growth model and then 
to explore the effects on this equilibrium of government debt. Samuel- 
son [8] has examined the determination of interest rates in a single- 
commodity world without durable goods. In such an economy, interest 
rates are determined by consumption loans between individuals of 
different ages. By introducing production employing a durable capital 
good into this model, one can examine the case where individuals pro- 
vide for their retirement years by lending to entrepreneurs. After de- 
scribing alternative long-run equilibria available to a centrally planned 
economy, the competitive solution is described. In this economy, which 
has an infinitely long life, it is seen that, despite the absence of all the 
usual sources of inefficiency, the competitive solution can be inefficient. 
Modigliani [4] has explored the effects of the existence of govern- 
ment debt in an aggregate growth model. By introducing a government 
which issues debt and levies taxes to finance interest payments into 
the model described in the first part, it is possible to re-examine his 
conclusions in a model where consumption decisions are made indi- 
vidually, where taxes to finance the debt are included in the analysis, 
and where the changes in output arising from changes in the capital 
stock are explicitly acknowledged. It is seen that in the "normal" case 
external debt reduces the utility of an individual living in long-run 
equilibrium. Surprisingly, internal debt is seen to cause an even larger 
decline in this utility level. 
External debt has two effects in the long run, both arising from the 
taxes needed to finance the interest payments. The taxes directly reduce 
available lifetime consumption of the individual taxpayer. Further, 
by reducing his disposable income, taxes reduce his savings and thus 
the capital stock. Internal debt has both of these effects as well as a 
further reduction in the capital stock arising from the substitution of 
government debt for physical capital in individual portfolios.

1. Technology 
The economy being considered here is assumed to have an infinite 
future. Its unchanging technology is assumed to be representable by a 
constant returns to scale aggregate production function, F(K, L).1 Since 
the economy exists in discrete time, the capital argument of the pro- 
duction function is the saving of the previous period plus the capital 
stock employed in the previous period. (It is assumed that there is no 
depreciation and that, since capital and output are the same com- 
modity, one can consume one's capital.) 
Individuals in this economy live for two periods, working in the first 
while being retired in the second. Each person has an ordinal utility 
function U(el, e2) based on his consumption in the two years of his life.2 
Denoting the number of persons born at the start of the tth period by 
Lt, labor force, growth satisfies: 
Li= 
L(1 + n)t. 
2. Centrally Planned Economy 
It is simplest to examine the production possibilities of this economy 
by examining the alternatives available to a central planning authority. 
With the capital stock in period t (which was determined in period t- 1) 
and the labor force in this period (which is exogenous), output will 
satisfy Y,=F(K,, 
L,). At the end of the production process (and before 
the start of consumption in this period) the central authorities have 
command over the capital stock and the newly produced output, 
Kt+ Yt. This must be divided between the capital stock which will be 
available for production in the next period, K,+1, and aggregate con- 
sumption in this period, C. This consumption must be further divided 
between members of the younger generation, Et', and those of the older 
generation, E,2. Assuming that all members of the same generation con- 
sume the same amount, we have:' 
1 
1 
2 
2 
Et = etLt, Et = et-1. 
The division of the resources on hand between the alternative uses can 
be stated algebraically: 
(1) 
Yt + Kt = Kt+1 + Ct = Kt+1 + e'Lt + e2LEt1, 
I It is assumed that F is twice differentiable and exhibits positive marginal products and a 
diminishing marginal rate of substitution everywhere. 
2 The assumption of the absence of all bequests is important for intertemporal allocation 
conclusions. A relationship between changes in the size of the national debt and changes in 
bequests can alter the effects to be described. 
3 Note that a person born in period t would consume et' and eOtl in his two years of life.

or more conventionally,

(2) 
Yt - (Kt+l- 
Kt) = Ct = etLt + ett. 
Assuming that the central authorities decide to preserve a constant 
capital-labor ratio, kt= Kt/L,, and thus Kt?1= (l +n)Kt, aggregate con- 
sumption will satisfy: 
1 
2 
(3) 
t - 
nKt = Ct 
etLt + etLt1. 
Denoting the output-labor ratio by yt= Yt/Lt, this can be rewritten as: 
(4) 
yt - 
nkt = CtILt = 
et + 
e2/(l + n). 
Maintenance of a constant capital-labor ratio implies, of course, a 
constant output per worker over time. Thus, this equation describes 
the consumption possibilities in each year of any period during which 
the capital-labor ratio remains constant. In particular, if a given capital- 
labor ratio is held constant for all time, the economy is on what has 
become known as a Golden Age Path. 
3. Neoclassical Stationary States or Golden Age Paths 
A Golden Age Path for an economy is an expansion path on which 
the capital-labor ratio (and thus the capital-output ratio and marginal 
product of capital) is kept constant. From equation (4) we see that the 
central-planning authorities can maintain any capital-labor ratio for 
which the output-capital ratio is not smaller than n (which is equivalent 
to the condition that the savings rate not exceed one). From equation 
(4), again, one can derive the amount of consumption that is possible 
in each period and thus calculate the Golden Age Path for which this is 
maximized. Similarly we can examine the alternative divisions of this 
consumption between individuals of different generations. Assuming 
that all individuals have the same lifetime consumption pattern, the 
problem of selecting the optimal Golden Age Path, the Golden Age 
Path on which each individual would have the highest utility level, 
subject to the constraint that all individuals have the same level, can 
be written: 
(5) 
Maximize U(el, e2) 
subject to el + e2/(1 + n) = y - nk. 
Thus the solution of the problem of selecting an optimal Golden Age 
Path treats the allocation of consumption over the lifetime of an indi- 
vidual in a similar fashion to the allocation of consumption, in a single 
year, between individuals of different ages. The selection between 
Golden Age Paths is, as is seen from (5), a selection which ignores initial 
conditions, and thus not a selection available to an economy, which 


--- Page 4 ---
DIAMOND: NATIONAL DEBT 
1129 
must weigh the advantages of a given long-run equilibrium against the 
costs of achieving it. 
4. The Golden Rule Path 
This maximization problem decomposes naturally into two separate 
problems, that of selecting the optimal capital-labor ratio, and thus 
the height of the consumption constraint, y-nk; 
and that of dividing 
this amount of consumption between the different individuals. The 
maximizing capital-labor ratio is seen from (5) to satisfy the condition 
that the marginal product of capital equal the rate of growth, FK =-n. 
This is the standard result on the nature of the Golden Rule Path, 
see, e.g., Phelps [6]. Note that the optimality of this capital-labor ratio 
is independent of the exact division of consumption (and selecting the 
optimal division is independent of the capital-labor ratio chosen). If 
the central planners choose a higher capital-labor ratio, they would be 
selecting an inefficient solution (in the standard sense including the 
problem of initial conditions, not just as a comparison of Golden Age 
Paths) in that they could discard capital, lowering the capital-labor 
ratio to the Golden Rule level, and preserve this capital-labor ratio 
forever, permitting a higher level of consumption in each period for- 
ever.4 
Utility maximizing consumption allocation clearly requires that 
-= 
(1 + n) 
2 - 
This is the allocation that would occur if consumption decisions were 
individually made employing a rate of interest for consumer decisions 
equal to the rate of growth. In examining the division of consumption 
when the capital-labor ratio is held constant, we are equivalently ex- 
amining a model in which there is only one factor of production, labor. 
Thus it is not surprising that the optimal allocation is the same as that 
found by Samuelson [8], which he called the biological optimum. Thus 
the optimal rate of interest is determined by the rate of population 
growth (which may or may not equal the marginal product of capital). 
This paradox arises from the comparison of stationary states. The shift- 
ing of one unit of consumption by an individual from his first to his 
second year is equivalent to removing one unit of consumption from 
each of the living members of the younger generation and giving this 
total to the contemporary older generation, of whom there are n per 
cent fewer members. 
4Dynamic 
inefficiencies of this sort in models both with and without technical change are 
examined by Phelps [7 ].

5. Competitive Framework 
To the technological possibilities which have been described above, 
it is necessary to replace the central planning framework by a market 
process for the determination of the saving rate in each period. The 
annual savings behavior of the economy will determine the long-run 
equilibrium to which the economy converges. In particular, we will be 
interested in comparing alternative Golden Age Paths to which the 
economy converges with different quantitites of government debt out- 
standing. Thus, only the long-run implications of national debt will be 
examined, thereby avoiding the problem of selecting a social welfare 
function for the evaluation of different individual utility levels (at the 
cost of failing to explore the total effects). 
By following the life history of a single individual, born, say, in 
period t, it is possible to trace out the market relations. This individual 
works in period t, for which he receives a wage, wt, which equals the 
marginal product of labor, FL(Kt, Lt). This wage he allocates between 
current and future consumption so as to maximize his utility function, 
given the rate of interest existing on one-period loans from period t to 
period t+1, rt+1. Thus, the members of the younger generation make 
up the supply side of the capital market. 
This individual will thus consume, in period t, the difference between 
his wage and the quantity he lends in the capital market, e6t=wt-st. 
In period t+1, he will consume his savings plus the accrued interest, 
e2t+1 = ( + rt+i) St. 
Capital demanders are entrepreneurs who wish to employ capital for 
production in period t+ 1. Thus the equilibrium interest rate will equal 
the marginal product of capital, rt+?=FK(Kt+l, Lt+1). 
6. Factor-Price Frontier 
The existence of the constant returns to scale production function, 
F(K, L), which can be written as Lf(k), implies a relationship between 
the marginal products of labor and capital which will be denoted by 
w -(r) 
.5 From the definitions r =j'(k) and w =f(k) - kf'(k) we see that:

Therefore, the quantity saved can be expressed as a function of the 
relevant wage and interest level, st - S(Wt, rt+?). It will be assumed that 
s is a differentiable function. From the assumption of normality, we 
have 0 <as/lw <1. However as/ar may be positive or negative. 
In addition to writing individual savings as a function of the wage 
and interest rates, it is possible to express the utility function in terms 
of these variables. From this derived form of the utility function one

as:

The demand curve for capital, which relates the capital stock in 
period t+ 1 to the interest rate, is merely the marginal product of cap- 
ital as a function of the capital-labor ratio:

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
Combining the demand and supply curves, equating St and Kt+l, we 
have the equilibrium condition in the capital market, which relates the 
interest rate to the wage rate of the previous period: 
(10) 
rt+i = f'(St/Lt?i) = f'(s(wt, rt+1)/(l + n)). 
From the assumptions made above, we know that the demand curve 
is downward-sloping, while the supply curve may have a positive or 
negative slope. This suggests that there are two cases which need to be 
treated separately as the demand or supply curve is more steeply nega- 
tively sloped.8 This is shown diagrammatically in Diagram 1.

The necessity of distinguishing the two cases is made clear by examining 
the relation between the equilibrium interest rate and the wage of the 
previous period. A higher wage in period t implies a greater quantity 
of saving at any interest rate, or a rightward shift of the saving curve 
in Diagram 1. However, whether this results in a higher or lower equi- 
librium level of saving depends on the relative slopes of the demand 
and supply curves. Geometrically, assuming w' > w, we have Diagram 2. 
In the diagram on the right, which represents the "normal" case in 
the capital market, a higher income level results in a higher equilibrium 
level of saving. In the diagram on the left, where the elasticity of saving 
with respect to the interest rate is large and negative, a rise in the level 
of income results in a fall in the equilibrium level of saving. This some- 
what perverse case leads to a reversal of the conclusions on the effect 
of debt (since taxes which reduce disposable income increase saving). 
Rather than complicate the text, we discuss this case in Appendix A. 
By altering the wage levels in period t, we could trace out the equi- 
librium interest rates which would occur in period t+ 1. This relation 
8 A requirement of Walrasian stability in the capital market would permit an elimination of 
the case where the supply curve is steeper than the demand curve. Marshallian stability would 
not, of course, permit this elimination. In the absence of a dynamic theory of the capital 
market, it seems best to consider both cases.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
Given a wage and interest pair in period one, (wj, rl), which is denoted 
by I in Diagram 3, the interest rate in the second period can be read 
from the i1 curve, given the wage in period one. With this interest rate 
in period two, the factor-price frontier, 4, gives the value of the wage 
in period two. The entire time path of the economy can be traced out 
in this diagram in similar fashion. 
As portrayed in Diagram 3, and as will be assumed throughout this 
paper, the economy has a single, stable equilibrium point. In order to 
derive this stability condition (which will be used to derive the direc- 
tion of changes in equilibrium values when debt is introduced), one 
first expresses rt+l as a function of rt:rt?,=4(44rt)). 
Taking the deriva- 
tive of this, and recalling equation (11) which implies that this deriva- 
tive is positive, we can express the necessary condition for stability as:

As is shown by the example in the next section, the competitive 
solution need not occur at an interest rate exceeding the Golden Rule 
level. Thus the competitive solution may be dynamically inefficient9 
since there exists a time after which the capital-labor ratio will exceed 
the Golden Rule level by a nonvanishing amount.'0 
10. An Example 
As an example, consider an economy with Cobb-Douglas production 
and utility functions. The utility function can be expressed as: 
U(el, e2) = 3 log el + (1 - 
3) log e2. 
The saving function derived from this is independent of r: 
s 
(1-)w. 
Thus 41 can be written:

With production satisfying:

this does not coincide with the Golden Rule. With a positive rate of 
growth of labor, different economies with different values of a or 
can clearly have interest rates either larger or smaller than n. 
11. Framework of Analysis 
In examining the long-run effects of national debt, there are two 
approaches that might be taken, corresponding to the two concepts of 
incidence, balanced-budget incidence and differential incidence." With 
balanced-budget incidence, the effects of a combination of changed ex- 
penditures and changed financing are examined, weighing the relative 
benefits and costs. Differential incidence refers to a comparison of 
alternative methods of financing a given expenditure level.12 
In this model, there are two forms which government expenditures 
could take, a current consumption item (which might best be viewed as 
lump-sum gifts to part of the populace) or government purchase of 
physical capital (which would then be rented to entrepreneurs for use 
in the production process in each future period, with the rental pay- 
ments distributed to the individuals as a social dividend). Combining 
these two forms of expenditures with the alternatives of tax or debt 
For a detailed discussion of these concepts, see Musgrave [51. 
12 The failure to distinguish between these separate questions has been the cause of some of 
the confusion in the literature on the public debt. See, e.g., Mishan 131. 


--- Page 11 ---
1136 
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
finance gives four possible questions of balanced-budget incidence which 
might be asked. 
However, although answers to some of these questions will arise, 
analysis will be restricted to the differential incidence question of sub- 
stituting debt for tax finance for a given government expenditure. 
This substitution could be employed while financing the purchase of 
physical capital. The long-run incidence question would then be resolved 
by comparing the long-run equilibrium arising when there is govern- 
ment capital and government debt with the long-run equilibrium occur- 
ring when there is only government capital. Since the simultaneous 
issuance of debt and purchase of capital would merely make the govern- 
ment a middleman between entrepreneurs and savers, this action would 
have no effect on the economy in either the short or long run. Thus the 
initial equilibrium would be compared to that arising when there is 
government-owned capital, but no debt outstanding. 
Alternatively, the government could finance some windfall payment 
(such as veterans' bonuses) either from concurrent taxes or debt is- 
suance. While tax-financed transfer payments would have an effect in 
the short run (depending on the relation between the recipients and the 
taxpayers), since it shifts neither 0 nor i1 it would have no effect on the 
long-run equilibrium. Thus the original long-run equilibrium could be 
compared to the one arising when debt exists (which shifts 41) but the 
expenditures had no permanent effect. Either of these differential inci- 
dence frameworks would lead to the same qualitative solutions, and 
the second one will be adopted. 
12. National Debt 
To avoid the problem of expected capital gains, it will be assumed 
that all government debt has a one-period maturity. It will also be 
assumed that the debt, which is refloated each period simultaneously 
with the achievement of equilibrium in the capital market, pays the 
current interest rate. For internally held debt this assumption is neces- 
sary, given the assumption of perfect certainty, for wealth owners to be 
willing to hold both debt and physical capital in their portfolios. The 
assumption is also made for externally held debt for the sake of sym- 
metry in the comparison of the two types of debt. The, perhaps, more 
natural assumption of a supply curve of external capital is discussed in 
Appendix B. With the assumption of a horizontal supply curve at an 
interest rate equalling the equilibrium domestic rate before the issuance 
of further debt, the qualitative results of this case are identical to those 
of the case considered in the text. 
Since the long-run effects of the debt depend on a permanent shift 
in c or t1, a fixed absolute amount of debt, in a growing economy, would 


--- Page 12 ---
DIAMOND: NATIONAL DEBT 
1137 
asymptotically have no effect. Therefore it will be assumed that the 
debt-labor ratio is held constant (that the quantity of debt grows at 
n per cent) by financing part of the interest cost by additional debt, 
while financing the remainder by taxes. (It should be noted that in the 
case of an inefficient competitive solution, where the rate of growth ex- 
ceeds the rate of interest, this implies negative taxes.) The measure of 
the quantity of debt outstanding in any period will be the quantity 
outstanding at the start of the period (or equivalently, at the time of 
the production process), which is therefore the quantity issued in the 
previous period. Thus the denominator of the debt-labor ratio refers to 
the number of individuals in the tax base for financing the debt, rather 
than the number of savers entering the capital market to purchase the 
debt. 
The taxes employed to finance interest costs (which are paid concur- 
rently with the receipt of factor payments) will be assumed to be lump- 
sum taxes on the younger generation.'3 
13. External Debt 
The effects of the existence of externally held debt on the domestic 
economy arise solely from the taxes needed to finance that part of the 
interest cost not covered by increased debt. Thus we would expect the 
utility of an individual living at the time of long-run equilibrium to 
decrease because of increased taxes (in the efficient case where the 
interest rate exceeds the growth rate) and to change because of the 
change in the equilibrium wage-interest rate pair caused by the impact 
of these taxes on the supply side of the capital market. Denoting the 
external debt-labor ratio by gi, the taxes per worker in period t are 
(rt- n)gl. Therefore, the equation for the t1 function must be changed to 
relate savings to the wage net of taxes tt, which equals wt-(rt-n)g,. 
Rewriting the condition for equilibrium in the capital market, equation 
(10), we have: 
(13) 
rt+i = 
(S(Wt - (rt - n)g,, rt+i) 
The new form of this equation implies a new stability condition which, 
together with the assumption on relative slopes in the capital market, 
is expressed in (14). (It is assumed that there is a single stable equi- 
librium both with and without the debt.) 
13 The case with lump-sum taxes on the older generation is equivalent to that with lump- 
sum taxes on the younger generation plus intergeneration transfers in each period. This trans- 
fer scheme (from old to young) increases saving in anticipation of taxes and counteracts the 
decreases described in the text, although not fully.

change in this quantity.

As was described above, external debt moves the interest rate away

The first term of this expression is the change in utility arising from 
the taxes needed to finance the addition to the outstanding debt, and 
is positive or negative as these taxes are positive or negative. The second 
term describes the change in the tax burden of existing debt occurring 
because of the change in the interest rate. Thus, both of these utility 
changes are positive if r exceeds n and negative if n exceeds r. 
The third term can be explained by means of Diagram 6 containing 
derived indifference curves between w and r, denoted by II, and the 
factor-price frontier.'-'

The change in the interest rate is a movement along the factor-price 
frontier. The change in utility thus depends on the relative slopes of 
the factor-price frontier, the slope of which is - k, and of the indifference 
curve, the slope of which is -s/(l+r). 
From the equilibrium condition 
for the capital market, k=s/(l+n), 
this term can be rewritten as 
dr / 
k \ 
dg, 
r(r- 
Since dr/dg, has the same sign as (r-n), 
the movement of the interest 
rate away from the Golden Rule level causes the utility from factor 
payments to fall. 
Combining the three effects, we can conclude that in the "normal" 
case where the competitive solution is efficient, external debt causes a

because of taxes.

fall in the utility level of an individual living in long-run equilibrium. 
If the competitive solution is inefficient the effects of the debt work in 
opposite directions and so yield no a priori conclusion. 
14. Internal Debt 
With internal debt, the supply side of the capital market is altered 
in precisely the same fashion as with external debt, since an individual 
taxpayer is in the same position as a taxpayer whether his tax payments 
flow abroad or remain in the country. Denoting the internal debt-labor 
ratio by g2, the savings function must be altered as before to read 
s(wt - (rt - n)g2, rt+l). 
It is also necessary to alter the equilibrium condition in the capital 
market to take account of the fact that the government enters on the 
demand side of this market. Denoting the quantity of internal debt to 
be floated in period t (and repaid in t+ 1) by Gt+?, the equilibrium con- 
dition becomes: 
(21) 
St- 
K+1 + Gt+-. 
Dividing this by Lt+1, we have the equilibrium condition expressed 
in terms of the ratios needed to describe the equilibrium: 
St 
(22) 
1+ 
- kt+l + g2- 
Comparing internal with external debt, we see that they both require 
taxes to be paid by each worker, while internal debt has a further effect 
in that it substitutes pieces of paper for physical capital in the port- 
folios of wealth owners, thus reducing output. 
Recalling that the demand for capital by entrepreneurs is determined 
by the marginal productivity schedule of capital, we can combine this 
equation with equation (22) to obtain the new condition for equilibrium 
in the capital market: 
(23) 
rt+i 
(S(Wt 
- 
(rt - +)g2,

From (24) and the normality of present consumption, 9s/dw <1, we 
know that this expression is positive and thus that V/ shifts upward for 
all values of r. 
Following the same analysis as with external debt, we can calculate 
the change in utility arising from the change in the level of internal 
debt. We write first the locus of equilibria for different quantities of 
debt:

Again, from equation (24), we know that the change in the equilibrium 
interest rate is positive. Employing equations (18) and (19) relating 
changes in utility and the net wage to changes in debt (which hold for 
either internal or external debt) and the equilibrium condition for the 
capital market, equation (22), we can express the changes in utility in 
two ways:

Equation (28) expresses the change in utility in terms of the taxes 
needed to finance the increase in debt, the taxes needed to finance the 
increased interest payments on existing debt, and the changed value 
of factor payments. As before, the sign of the first two terms depends 


--- Page 18 ---
DIAMOND: NATIONAL DEBT 
1143 
solely on (r-n). 
However, since s=(l+n) 
(k+g2), the third term, 
while decreasing utility when r is smaller than n, may increase or de- 
crease utility when the competitive solution is efficient. 
Equation (29), which combines the separate terms, shows that utility 
is decreased in the efficient case and increased in the inefficient case. 
Like the third term in the expression giving the change in utility from 
external debt, the sign of this expression is the opposite of the sign of 
(r-n)dr/dg. 
Separating the effects of debt issuance into those which 
alter the social consumption possibilities (the flow of interest payments 
abroad) and those that reflect a change in the allocation of consump- 
tion within the society, the total impact of all effects falling into the 
second group will increase or decrease utility as the interest rate is 
moved toward or away from the rate of growth. This is demonstrated 
geometrically in the next section. 
15. Diagrammatic Discussion 
The assumption that both present and future consumption are nor- 
mal goods implies that, as one moves upward and to the left along a 
budget line, the indifference curves become steeper. Geometrically, 
this implies that the slope at A is algebraically greater than at B. See 
Diagram 7.

Diagram 7 
Recalling equation (5), the consumption possibilities for a society 
with a given capital-labor ratio lie along the line el+ e2/(l +n) = y- nk. 
Since the interest rate is the marginal product of capital in a competi- 
tive society, from the interest rate we know the height of the consump- 
tion constraint line. Furthermore, since consumption is allocated over 
time in accordance with the market interest rate, we know that the 


--- Page 19 ---

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
competitive equilibrium occurs where the slope of an indifference curve 
equals - (1 +r). These two facts permit us to locate a competitive equi- 
librium in Diagram 7, knowing just the equilibrium interest rate (and, 
of course, the production function). Since internal debt does not alter 
the consumption possibilities available to an economy, the utility asso- 
ciated with the equilibrium arising from varying quantities of internal 
debt can be located in this diagram. (This, of course, is not true for ex- 
ternal debt.) 
Combining these two facets of a change in the interest rate we can 
conclude that any movement of the interest rate away from the growth 
rate decreases utility first by diminishing the height of the consump- 
tion constraint line and second by moving along the lowered line in the 
direction of decreased utility. Assuming r' > r> n, this is shown in 
Diagram 8 where A is the equilibrium point associated with r while C 
is the one associated with r'. 
e 
A

Utility at B (where the slope of the indifference curve is the same as 
at A) is less than utility at A since B is on a lower constraint line. The 
slope at C, which equals - (1 + r'), is less than at B, - (1 + r), implying 
a lower utility level at C than at B. 
Thus internal debt raises or lowers the utility level as it moves the 
equilibrium interest rate towards or away from the growth rate. Ex- 
ternal debt has two effects, an alternation of consumption possibilities 
due to the flow abroad of interest payments and an alteration of utility 
arising from changes in the interest rate, given the level of interest pay- 
ments, which is positive or negative as the interest rate is moved toward 
or away from the growth rate. 
Thus the third term in dU/dgi, which is the "purely domestic" effect 
of issuing external debt corresponds to the entire effects of internal 
debt, with the sign of the expressions equalling that of -(r-n)dr/dg.

16. Internal and External Debt 
Having described the way each of them affects the equilibrium of the 
economy, it is now possible to turn to the complete model, in which there 
is both external and internal debt, and so make a direct comparison of 
their effects.16 
Without stopping to repeat the analysis step by step, we can write 
down the relevant equations from the equations derived in the last 
three sections:

16 In Section 14, the change from external to internal debt was described as adding the 
effect arising from the substitution of paper for physical capital in portfolios. Reversing this 
comparison, external debt is internal debt plus annual foreign borrowing, with foreign capital 
receiving its marginal product. This does not directly alter net output, but it does alter rela- 
tive factor prices which directly affects utility and which alters savings.

With these relations before us, it is possible to examine the differential 
incidence question arising from the effects of issuing internal debt to 
retire external debt, and to examine the relationships between some of 
the articles in the literature on the burden of the debt. 
From equation (33) we can calculate the change in the equilibrium 
interest rate arising from this debt swap:

From the stability condition, (32), we know that the denominator of this 
expression is positive and thus that the interest rate always rises. The 
effect of the debt swap involves no change in taxes, and so no change in 
the supply side of the capital market. However, the demand side is 
altered by the increase in government demand, causing a rise in the 
equilibrium interest rate and a fall in the capital-labor ratio. 
The change in utility can be derived from (34) and expressed in 
different ways:

Equation (36) divides the utility change into the part arising from 
the change in taxes and the part arising from the change in the utility

utility. However, since

as in the discussion of internal debt, the change in utility coming from 
the change in factor payments may be positive or negative. 
Equation (37) divides the utility change into the part arising from 
the change in the external interest payments, which may be positive 
or negative, and the part arising, as in the last section, domestically, 
from the change in equilibrium values, given the level of external pay- 
ments. This term has the sign 
) dr 
dr 
dg2 
dgi 
which is, therefore, the sign of n-r. 
Thus, as before, for this term the 
rise in interest rates raises utility in the inefficient case but lowers it in 
the efficient case. 
The third form of the equation, (38), is expressed to most easily give 
the sign of the utility change. When the solution is efficient, we have 
an unambiguous fall in utility from this debt swap. In the inefficient case 
the sign depends on the relative sizes of 
(k + g2)(r - n) 
gi, and-- 
(1 +r) 
17. Conclusion 
Thus we have seen that, where both types of debt exist, internal debt, 
which raises the interest rate, lowers utility in the efficient case but 
may raise or lower it in the inefficient case (if there were no external 
debt, utility would be raised in the inefficient case). External debt, 
which moves the interest rate away from the growth rate, lowers utility 
in the efficient case and may raise or lower it in the inefficient case 
(this remains true whether or not internal debt exists). Finally, the 
substitution of internal for external debt, which raises the interest rate, 
lowers utility in the efficient case, while being capable of raising or 
lowering it in the inefficient case. 
There are two ways of classifying the effects of external and internal 
debt which shed some light on some of the effects described in the litera- 
ture. 
First, as in equation (34), they can be divided into utility changes 
arising from changes in taxes paid and from a change in the relative 
factor payments. This division shows that the taxes needed to finance 
either internal or external debt have the same impact on individuals 
living during long-run equilibrium. 
Second, the change in utility from internal debt can be separated 
into the effects of external debt plus the effects of a debt swap. This 


--- Page 23 ---
1148 
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
would imply four effects, the effects of the two changes in taxes, and 
the two effects on factor payments. These latter two effects can be 
distinguished by the fact that external debt affects only the supply 
side of the capital market, while the debt swap affects only the de- 
mand side. 
In their discussion of the effects of debt, Bowen, Davis, and Kopf 
[1] concentrated on the tax effects of internal debt, and so described 
the first two of these four effects. 
Modigliani [4] and Vickrey [10] discussed the fall in the capital 
stock arising from the substitution of debt for capital in the portfolios 
of wealth owners. As such, they were discussing the change in the de- 
mand side of the capital market"7 and the effects described are additive 
to those arising from taxes. It is only necessary to add the effects of 
taxes on the capital stock (and thus on factor payments) to complete the 
discussion.

Making the alternative assumption on the capital market, which, to-

we can re-examine the signs of the equations in Section 16. The denominators 
of the expressions giving the change in the equilibrium interest rate are now 
negative (where they were positive in the text). Thus external debt moves 
the interest rate toward the growth rate, while internal debt lowers its 
equilibrium value. Consequently the debt swap lowers the rate of interest. 
Therefore, in the efficient case, increased debt causes positive taxes for 
the additional debt but lowers the taxes on existing debt and so may raise 
or lower the utility level. The debt swap raises utility by decreasing taxes 
17 Modigliani described a one-for-one replacement of capital by debt, assuming that total 
wealth remained constant. However, the fall in the capital stock, which causes a fall in out- 
put, would affect the equilibrium quantity of total wealth. (Modigliani acknowledges this 
but ignores its effects.) The change in the capital stock can be derived from equation (33):

and increasing the utility of factor payments by moving the interest rate

APPENDIX B 
Assuming a supply curve of external debt which can be expressed by 
writing the interest rate, p, as a function of gi (this assumes that the source 
of foreign capital is also increasing at n per cent per year), the net wage can 
be expressed: 
w = w -(p 
- 
n)gi - (r -
