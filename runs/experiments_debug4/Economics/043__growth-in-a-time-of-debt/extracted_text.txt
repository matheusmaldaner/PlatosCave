Ergodicity economics is a new branch of economic theory that notes the conceptual diﬀerence
between time averages and expectation values, which coincide only for ergodic observables.
It
postulates that individual agents maximise the time average growth rate of wealth, known widely
as growth optimality. This contrasts with the dominant behavioural model in economics, expected
utility theory, in which agents maximise expectation values of changes in psychologically transformed
wealth. Historically, growth optimality was explored for additive and multiplicative gambles. Here
we apply it to a general class of wealth dynamics, extending the range of economic situations where it
may be used. Moreover, we show a correspondence between growth optimality and expected utility
theory, in which the ergodicity transformation in the former is identiﬁed as the utility function in
the latter. This correspondence oﬀers a theoretical basis for choosing utility functions and predicts
that wealth dynamics are strong determinants of risk preferences.

INTRODUCTION
Expected utility theory (EUT) is a foundational model
of decisions under uncertainty, originating in [1]. In it,
an individual agent maximises the mathematical expec-
tation of the random change in a nonlinear transforma-
tion of wealth. This transformation is known as the util-
ity function.
It is viewed as encoding the agent’s id-
iosyncratic aversion to risk which, under the standard
assumption of ﬁxed preferences, is stable in time and
independent of exogenous factors.
In short, agents in
EUT care about the average over all possible changes of
a transformation of wealth that reﬂects their hard-wired
psychology.
Since utility is a psychological construct, EUT oﬀers no
way of reasoning deductively which utility function will
best predict a real person’s decisions.
In the revealed
preferences framework, such decisions are observed ﬁrst
and a utility function is ﬁtted to the data. If the person’s
preferences are stable and well characterised by the ﬁtted
utility function, then it is hoped their future decisions will
be predictable using EUT. In practice, therefore, the the-
ory is circular: it claims that agents maximise expected
utility and deﬁnes this as the quantity agents are ob-
served to maximise. It can be used to represent observed
decisions but not to predict them a priori.
Ergodicity economics (EE) is a recent branch of eco-
nomics that examines the use of expectation values in
economic models. See [13] and references therein. Expec-
tation values are, by the law of large numbers, additive
averages over inﬁnitely many realisations of a random
variable. Where the random variable models a quantity
of interest to an economic agent, like a change in wealth,
its expectation value resembles the outcome achieved by
each member of a large collective of agents, who agree to

pool and share their individual outcomes. The expecta-
tion value has no mechanistic relevance to an individual
agent, who is exposed to only one of the possible out-
comes. The eﬀect of a sequence of random variables on
the agent’s wealth may be well characterised by a time
average. The ergodicity question asks whether time av-
erages are equivalent to expectation values. In general,
and in particular for the increments of growth processes
encountered in economics, they are not.
The transformation of wealth to utility in EUT can be
viewed as a way of restoring empirical relevance to the-
oretically irrelevant expectation values, by introducing
freedom to enable their ﬁtting to behavioural data. EE
develops decision theory in a conceptually diﬀerent way:
by modelling physical (i.e. untransformed) economic ob-
servables, like wealth; and by specifying averages that
are mechanistically relevant to individual agents (rather
than to hypothetical collectives).
More speciﬁcally, and conﬁning attention to wealth,
EE seeks to build realistic models of its temporal evolu-
tion. These models take the form of stochastic processes,
whose generating equations are known as wealth dynam-
ics. The dynamics depend on the economic circumstances
of the agent and are deﬁned exogenously to the agent’s
preferences. For example, an agent with labour income
and no savings would be well modelled as experiencing
additive changes in wealth, while for an agent with sig-
niﬁcant invested capital a multiplicative dynamic would
be more realistic.
EE posits that an agent is concerned with the time av-
erage growth rate of wealth, i.e. that achieved in a single
trajectory of the stochastic process over long time. This
is the mechanistically relevant maximand for an individ-
ual exposed to a sequence of economic choices. In con-
trast, the growth rate of the expectation value of wealth,
i.e. the average over all possible trajectories, would be
relevant to a collective of agents. For general wealth dy-
namics, these growth rates are diﬀerent.
In EE all agents are assumed to have the same prefer-

ence: to maximise the time average growth rate of wealth.
This decision criterion is not new and is often referred to
as growth optimality. It has a long history in the setting
of multiplicative gambles, made famous as the “Kelly cri-
terion” in the 1950s [6] and dating as far back as the 1870s
[16]. The cases of additive and multiplicative wealth dy-
namics were treated in the EE framework in [14].
What is a growth rate? In simple terms, it is the co-
eﬃcient of time in a growth function. Diﬀerent dynam-
ics correspond to diﬀerent growth functions and, there-
fore, to diﬀerent growth rates. For example, wealth that
grows linearly in time, x = gt, has its growth rate ex-
tracted by the operation dx/dt = g; while for exponen-
tial growth, x = exp(gt), the growth rate is extracted
by d ln x/dt = g. In both cases, a constant is obtained
from a time-varying function as the rate of change of
transformed wealth, linear and logarithmic in these sim-
ple examples. In stochastic growth models, it is no longer
possible to ﬁnd functions of wealth whose rates of change
are constant. Instead, the function, known in EE as the
ergodicity transformation, is chosen to extract an ergodic
growth rate from the stochastic process.
We do two things in this paper. Firstly, we generalise
growth optimality beyond the additive and multiplica-
tive wealth dynamics treated in the literature hitherto.
Economically speaking, we allow wealth to evolve in a
general manner, rather than through income and con-
sumption ﬂows or the compounding of investments. This
broadens the range of economic situations that can be
modelled in EE.
Secondly, we draw a correspondence between EE and
EUT by noting that the time average of the ergodic
growth rate for given wealth dynamics is, by virtue of
its ergodicity, equal to its expectation value. This allows
growth optimal decisions to be formulated as maximis-
ing expected utility, by identifying the utility function in
EUT as the ergodicity transformation for the wealth dy-
namics in EE. We show that this correspondence exists
for a class of wealth dynamics, speciﬁcally those that ad-
mit an ergodicity transformation, and we derive the con-
ditions for membership of this class. Going in the oppo-
site direction, we show that all invertible utility functions
have corresponding wealth dynamics for which expected
utility maximisation is growth optimal.
This correspondence between two conceptually diﬀer-
ent but well established behavioural models opens tan-
talising new avenues to researchers in both areas. Since
wealth dynamics are deﬁned exogenously, the apparent
utility function of an agent is predicted a priori. In other
words, EE provides a theoretical basis for the choice of
utility function in EUT, absent from the latter frame-
work. Conversely, if a utility function is already speciﬁed
in an EUT model, EE gives it a physical interpretation in
terms of wealth dynamics. Furthermore, the exogeneity
of wealth dynamics implies that, if dynamics change, so
do the agent’s apparent preferences. This contrasts with
the standard of assumption of ﬁxed preferences. Recent
experiments with controllable wealth dynamics have been
conducted to compare the predictions of EE against those
of EUT with ﬁxed preferences [9]. They support the pre-
diction of EE that dynamics are strong determinants of
preferences.
II.
EXPECTED UTILITY THEORY
Here we provide a brief recap of EUT. To keep it rele-
vant and manageable, we restrict it to ﬁnancial decisions.
We will not consider the utility of an apple or a poem,
but only utility diﬀerences between diﬀerent monetary
amounts. We restrict ourselves to situations where any
non-ﬁnancial attendant circumstances of the decision can
be disregarded. In other words, we work with a form of
homo economicus.
For an agent facing a choice between diﬀerent courses
of action, the workﬂow of EUT is as follows.
1. Imagine everything that could happen under the
diﬀerent actions:
Associate with any action A, B, C, . . . a set of pos-
sible future events ΩA, ΩB, ΩC, . . . .
2. Estimate how likely the consequences of each ac-
tion are and how they aﬀect your wealth:
For set ΩA, associate a probability p(ωA) and a
change in wealth ∆xωAwith each elementary event
ωA ∈ΩA, and similarly for all other sets.
3. Specify how these outcomes aﬀect your utility:
Deﬁne a utility function, u(x), that depends only on
wealth and describes the agent’s risk preferences.
4. Aggregate the utility changes for each event:
Compute the expected changes in utility asso-
ciated
with
each
available
action,
⟨∆uA⟩
=
P
ΩA p(ωA)u(x+∆x(ωA))−u(x), and similarly for
actions B, C, . . . .
5. Pick the action that increases your utility most:
The option with the highest expected utility change
is the agent’s preferred choice.
We assume all steps in this workﬂow are possible.
Thus we assume that all possible future events, asso-
ciated probabilities, and changes in wealth are known;
that a suitable utility function is available; and that the
mathematical expectation of utility changes is the mathe-
matical object whose ordering reﬂects preferences among
actions.
For simplicity, we also make the common as-
sumption that the time between taking an action and
experiencing the corresponding change in wealth is inde-
pendent of the action taken.
III.
TECHNICAL
Here we present the technical development of decision
theory in EE, namely time average growth rate maximi-
sation under general wealth dynamics.

We suppose that an individual’s wealth evolves over
time according to a stochastic process.
This is a de-
parture from classical decision theory, where wealth is
supposed to be described by a random variable without
dynamic. To turn a gamble into a stochastic process and
enable the techniques we have developed, a dynamic must
be assumed, that is, a mode of repetition of the gamble,
see [14].
The individual is required to choose one from a set of
alternative stochastic processes, say x(t) and x∗(t). We
suppose that this is done by considering how the decision
maker would fare in their long-time limits.
At each decision time, t0, our individual acts to max-
imise subsequent changes in his wealth by selecting x(t)
so that if he waits long enough his wealth will be greater
under the chosen process than under the alternative pro-
cess with certainty. Mathematically speaking, there ex-
ists a suﬃciently large t such that the probability of the
chosen x(t) being greater than x∗(t) is arbitrarily close
to one,
∀ε, x∗(t)
∃∆t
s.t.
P(∆x > ∆x∗) > 1 −ϵ,
(1)
where 0 < ε < 1 and
∆x ≡x(t0 + ∆t) −x(t0),
(2)
with ∆x∗similarly deﬁned.
The criterion is necessarily probabilistic since the
quantities ∆x and ∆x∗are random variables and it might
be possible for the latter to exceed the former for any ﬁ-
nite ∆t. Only in the limit ∆t →∞does the randomness
vanish from the system.
Conceptually this criterion is tantamount to maximis-
ing lim∆t→∞{∆x} or, equivalently, lim∆t→∞{∆x/∆t}.
However, neither limit is guaranteed to exist. For exam-
ple, consider a choice between two geometric Brownian
motions,
dx = x(µdt + σdW),
(3)
dx∗= x∗(µ∗dt + σ∗dW),
(4)
with µ > σ2/2 and µ∗> σ∗2/2. The quantities ∆x/∆t
and ∆x∗/∆t both diverge in the limit ∆t →∞and a
criterion requiring the larger to be selected fails to yield
a decision.
To overcome this problem we introduce a montonically
increasing function of wealth, which we call suggestively
u(x). We deﬁne:
∆u ≡u(x(t0 + ∆t)) −u(x(t0));
(5)
∆u∗≡u(x∗(t0 + ∆t)) −u(x∗(t0)).
(6)
The monotonicity of u(x) means that the events ∆x >
∆x∗and ∆u > ∆u∗are the same. Taking ∆t > 0 allows
this event to be expressed as ∆u/∆t > ∆u∗/∆t, whence
the decision criterion in (Eq. 1) becomes
∀ε, x∗(t)
∃∆t
s.t.

> 1 −ϵ.
(7)
Our decision criterion has been recast such that it fo-
cuses on the rate of change
r ≡∆u
∆t ,
(8)
As before, it is conceptually similar to maximising
¯r ≡
lim
∆t→∞
∆u
∆t

=
lim
∆t→∞{r}.
(9)
If x(t) satisﬁes certain conditions, to be discussed be-
low, then the function u(x) can be chosen such that this
limit exists. We shall see that ¯r is then the time-average
growth rate mentioned in Section I. For the moment we
leave our criterion in the probabilistic form of (Eq. 7)
but to continue the discussion we assume that the limit
(Eq. 9) exists.
Everything is now set up to make the link to EUT.
Perhaps (Eq. 9) is the same as the rate of change of the
expectation value of ∆u
⟨∆u⟩
∆t
= ⟨r⟩.
(10)
We could then make the identiﬁcation of u(x) being the
utility function, noting that our criterion is equivalent to
maximizing the rate of change in expected utility. We
note ∆u and hence r are random variables but ⟨r⟩is not.
Taking the long-time limit is one way of removing ran-
domness from the problem, and taking the expectation
value is another. The expectation value is simply another
limit: it’s an average over N realizations of the random
number ∆u, in the limit N →∞. The eﬀect of removing
randomness is that the process x(t) is collapsed into the
scalar ∆u, and consistent transitive decisions are possible
by ranking the relevant scalars. In general, maximising
⟨r⟩does not yield the same decisions as the criterion es-
poused in (Eq. 7). This is only the case for a particular
function u(x) whose shape depends on the process x(t).
Our aim is to ﬁnd these pairs of processes and functions.
When using such u(x) as the utility function, EUT will
be consistent with optimisation over time. It is then pos-
sible to interpret observed behavior that is found to be
consistent with EUT using the utility function u(x) in
purely dynamical terms: such behavior will lead to the
fastest possible wealth growth over time.
We ask what sort of dynamic u must follow so that ¯r =
⟨r⟩or, put another way, so that r is an ergodic observable,
in the sense that its time and ensemble averages are the
same [7, p. 32].
We start by expressing the change in utility, ∆u, as a
sum over M equal time intervals,
∆u ≡u(t0 + ∆t) −u(t0)
(11)
=
M
X
m=1
[u(t0 + mδt) −u(t0 + (m −1)δt)] (12)
=

(13)


--- Page 4 ---

where δt ≡∆t/M and δum(t) ≡u(t0 + mδt) −u(t0 +
(m −1)δt). From (Eq. 9) we have
¯r =
lim
∆t→∞

(14)
=

M→∞
(

(15)
keeping δt ﬁxed. From (Eq. 10) we obtain
⟨r⟩= lim
N→∞
(
1
N
N
X
n=1
∆un
∆t
)
(16)
where each ∆un is drawn independently from the distri-
bution of ∆u.
We now compare the two expressions (Eq. 15) and
(Eq. 16). Clearly the value of ¯r in (Eq. 15) cannot depend
on the way in which the diverging time period is parti-
tioned, so the length of interval δt must be arbitrary and
can be set to the value of ∆t in (Eq. 16), for consistency
we then call δum(t) = ∆um(t). Expressions (Eq. 15) and
(Eq. 16) are equivalent if the successive additive incre-
ments, ∆um(t), are distributed identically to the ∆un
in (Eq. 16), which requires only that they are stationary
and independent.
Thus we have a condition on u(t) which suﬃces to
make ¯r = ⟨r⟩, namely that it be a stochastic process
whose additive increments are stationary and indepen-
dent. This means that u(t) is, in general, a L´evy process.
Without loss of realism we shall restrict our attention to
processes with continuous paths. According to a theo-
rem stated in [4, p. 2] and proved in [2, Chapter 12] this
means that u(t) must be a Brownian motion with drift,
du = audt + budW,
(17)
where dW is the inﬁnitesimal increment of the Wiener
process.
By arguing backwards we can address concerns regard-
ing the existence of ¯r. If u follows the dynamics speciﬁed
by (Eq. 17), then it is straightforward to show that the
limit ¯r always exists and takes the value a. Consequently
the decision criterion (Eq. 7) is equivalent to the optimi-
sation of ¯r, the time-average growth rate. The process
x(t) may be chosen such that (Eq. 17) does not apply
for any choice of u(x). In this case we cannot interpret
EUT dynamically, and such processes are likely to be
pathological.
This gives our central result:
For EUT to be equivalent to optimisation over
time, utility must follow an additive stochastic pro-
cess with stationary increments which, in our frame-
work, we shall take to be a Brownian motion with
drift.
This is a fascinating general connection. If the phys-
ical reason why we observe non-linear utility functions
is the non-linear eﬀect of ﬂuctuations over time, then a
given utility function encodes a corresponding stochastic
wealth process. Provided that a utility function u(x) is
invertible, i.e. provided that its inverse, x(u), exists, a
simple application of Itˆo calculus to (Eq. 17) yields di-
rectly the SDE obeyed by the wealth, x.
Thus every
invertible utility function encodes a unique dynamic in
wealth which arises from a Brownian motion in utility.
This is explored further below.
IV.
DYNAMIC FROM A UTILITY FUNCTION
We now illustrate the relationship between utility func-
tions and wealth dynamics.
For the reasons discussed
above we assume that utility follows a Brownian motion
with drift.
If u(x) can be inverted to x(u) = u−1(u), and x(u)
is twice diﬀerentiable, then it is possible to ﬁnd the
dynamic that corresponds to the utility function u(x).
Equation (17) is an Itˆo process. Itˆo’s lemma tells us that
dx will be another Itˆo process, and Itˆo’s formula speciﬁes
how to ﬁnd dx in terms of the relevant partial derivatives
dx =
∂x
∂t + au

∂u + 1

(18)
We have thus shown that
Theorem 1. For any invertible utility function u(x) a
class of corresponding wealth processes dx can be obtained
such that the (linear) rate of change in the expectation
value of net changes in utility is the time-average growth
rate of wealth.
As a consequence, optimizing expected changes in such
utility functions is equivalent to optimizing the time-
average growth, in the sense of Section III, under the
corresponding wealth process.
The origin of optimizing expected utility can be un-
derstood as follows: in the 18th century, the distinction
between ergodic and non-ergodic processes was unknown,
and all stochastic processes were treated by computing
expectation values. Since the expectation value of the
wealth process is an irrelevant mathematical object to
an individual whose wealth is modelled by a non-ergodic
process the available methods failed. The formalism was
saved by introducing a non-linear mapping of wealth,
namely the utility function.
The (failed) expectation
value criterion was interpreted as theoretically optimal,
and the non-linear utility functions were interpreted as
a psychologically motivated pattern of human behavior.
Conceptually, this is wrong.
Optimization of time-average growth recognizes the
non-ergodicity of the situation and computes the appro-
priate object from the outset – a procedure whose build-


--- Page 5 ---

ing blocks were developed beginning in the late 19th cen-
tury. It does not assume anything about human psychol-
ogy and indeed predicts that the same behavior will be
observed in any growth-optimizing entities that need not
be human.
A.
Examples
Equation (18), creates pairs of utility functions u(x)
and dynamics dx. In discrete time, two such pairs were
investigated in [14], namely cases 1. and 2. below.
1.
Linear utility
The trivial linear utility function corresponds to addi-
tive wealth dynamics (Brownian motion),
u(x) = x
↔
dx = audt + budW.
(19)
2.
Logarithmic utility
Introduced by Bernoulli in 1738 [1], the logarithmic
utility function is in wide use and corresponds to multi-
plicative wealth dynamics (geometric Brownian motion),
u(x) = ln(x)
↔
dx = x

au + 1
2b2
u

dt + budW

.
(20)
In practice the most useful case will be multiplicative
wealth dynamics. But to demonstrate the generality of
the procedure, we carry it out for a diﬀerent special case
that is historically important.
3.
Square-root (Cramer) utility
The ﬁrst utility function ever to be suggested was the
square-root function u(x) = x1/2, by Cramer in a 1728
letter to Daniel Bernoulli, partially reproduced in [1].
This function is invertible, namely x(u) = u2, so that
(Eq. 18) applies. We note that the square root, in a spe-
ciﬁc sense, sits between the linear function and the log-
arithm: limx→∞x1/2
x
= 0 and limx→∞
ln(x)
x1/2 = 0. Since
linear utility produces additive dynamics and logarith-
mic utility produces multiplicative dynamics, we expect
square-root utility to produce something in between or
some mix. Substituting for x(u) in (Eq. 18) and carrying
out the diﬀerentiations we ﬁnd
dx =

2aux1/2 + b2
u

dt + 2bux1/2dW
(21)
The drift term contains a multiplicative element (by
which we mean an element with x-dependence) and an
additive element.
We see that the square-root utility
function that lies between the logarithm and the linear
function indeed represents a dynamic that is partly ad-
ditive and partly multiplicative.
(Eq. 21) is reminiscent of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model
[3] in ﬁnancial mathematics, especially if au < 0. Simi-
lar dynamics, i.e. with a noise amplitude that is propor-
tional to √x, are also studied in the context of absorbing-
state phase transitions in statistical physics [5, 8]. That a
300-year-old letter is related to recent work in statistical
mechanics is not surprising: the problems that motivated
the development of decision theory, and indeed of prob-
ability theory itself are far-from equilibrium processes.
Methods to study such processes were only developed in
the 20th century and constitute much of the work cur-
rently carried out in statistical mechanics.
V.
UTILITY FUNCTION FROM A DYNAMIC
We now ask under what circumstances the procedure
in (Eq. 18) can be inverted. When can a utility func-
tion be found for a given dynamic? In other words, what
conditions does the dynamic dx have to satisfy so that
optimization over time can be represented by optimiza-
tion of expected net changes in utility u(x)?
We ask whether a given dynamic can be mapped into
a utility whose increments are described by Brownian
motion, (Eq. 17).
The dynamic is an arbitrary Itˆo process
dx = ax(x)dt + bx(x)dW,
(22)
where ax(x) and bx(x) are arbitrary functions of x. For
this dynamic to translate into a Brownian motion for the
utility, u(x) must satisfy the equivalent of (Eq. 18) with
the special requirement that the coeﬃcients au and bu in
(Eq. 17) be constants, namely
du =

ax(x)∂u
∂x + 1
2b2
x(x)∂2u
∂x2

|
{z
}
au
dt + bx(x)∂u
∂x
|
{z
}
bu
dW. (23)
Explicitly, we arrive at two equations for the coeﬃcients
au = ax(x)u′ + 1
2b2
x(x)u′′
(24)
and
bu = bx(x)u′.
(25)
Diﬀerentiating (Eq. 25), it follows that
u′′(x) = −bub′
x(x)
b2x(x) .
(26)
Substituting in (Eq. 24) for u′ and u′′ and solving for
ax(x) we ﬁnd the drift term as a function of the noise
term,
ax(x) = au
bu
bx(x) + 1
2bx(x)b′
x(x).
(27)


--- Page 6 ---
6
In other words, knowledge of only the dynamic is suﬃ-
cient to determine whether a corresponding utility func-
tion exists. We do not need to construct the utility func-
tion explicitly to know whether a pair of drift term and
noise term is consistent or not.
Having determined for some dynamic that a consistent
utility function exists, we can construct it by substituting
for bx(x) in (Eq. 24). This yields a diﬀerential equation
for u
au = ax(x)u′ + b2
u
2u′2 u′′
(28)
or
0 = −auu′2 + ax(x)u′3 + b2
u
2 u′′.
(29)
Overall, then the triplet noise term, drift term, utility
function is interdependent. Given a noise term we can
ﬁnd consistent drift terms, and given a drift term we
ﬁnd a consistency condition (diﬀerential equation) for the
utility function.
A.
Example
Given a dynamic, it is possible to check whether this
dynamic can be mapped into a utility function, and the
utility function itself can be found. We consider the fol-
lowing example
dx =
au
bu
e−x −1
2e−2x

dt + e−xdW.
(30)
We note that ax(x) = au
bu e−x −1
2e−2x and bx(x) = e−x.
Equation (27) imposes conditions on the drift term ax(x)
in terms of the noise term bx(x). Substituting in (Eq. 27)
reveals that the consistency condition is satisﬁed by the
dynamic in (Eq. 30).
A typical trajectory of (Eq. 30) is shown in Fig. 1.

with C an arbitrary constant of integration. This con-
stant corresponds to the fact that only changes in utility
are meaningful, as was pointed out by von Neumann and
Morgenstern [15] – this robust feature is visible whether
one thinks in dynamic terms and time averages or in
terms of consistent measure-theoretic concepts and ex-
pectation values.
Substituting for bx(x) from (Eq. 30), (Eq. 31) becomes
u′(x) = buex,
(33)
which is easily integrated to
u(x) = buex + C,
(34)
plotted in Fig. 2.
This expoential utility function is
monotonic and therefore invertible, which is reﬂected
in the fact that the consistency condition is satisﬁed.
The utility function is convex.
From the perspective
of expected-utility theory an individual behaving opti-
mally according to this function would be labelled “risk-
seeking.” The dynamical perspective corresponds to a
qualitatively diﬀerent interpretation: Under the dynamic

(Eq. 30) the “risk-seeking” individual behaves optimally,
in the sense that his wealth will grow faster than that
of a risk-averse individual. The dynamic (Eq. 30) has
the feature that ﬂuctuations in wealth become smaller as
wealth grows. High wealth is therefore sticky – an indi-
vidual will quickly ﬂuctuate out of low wealth and into
higher wealth. It will then tend to stay there.

WEALTH DISTRIBUTION FROM A
DYNAMIC
The dynamical interpretation of EUT makes it partic-
ularly simple to compute wealth distributions. A util-
ity function u(x) implies a dynamic x(t), and that dy-
namic generates a wealth distribution Px(x, t). We know
that u(t) follows a simple Brownian motion, wherefore
we know that u(t) is normally distributed according to
Pu(u, t) = N
 aut, b2
ut2
.
(35)
Since we know Pu(u, t), the distribution of x is easily
derived. The wealth distribution in a large population,
is
Px(x, t) = Pu(u(x), t)du
dx.

Example of a wealth distribution
The utility function (Eq. 34) corresponds to the exam-
ple dynamic (Eq. 30). The wealth distribution at any
time t can be read oﬀ(Eq. 36)

buex,
(37)
which is shown in Fig. 3.
The distribution is sensible
given what we know about the dynamic – since ﬂuctu-
ations diminish with increasing wealth many individuals
will be found at high wealth (all those that have ﬂuctu-
ated away from low wealth), with a heavy tail towards
lower wealth.

Utility
FIG. 2: Utility function of (Eq. 34), with bu = 1 and C = 0.
Optimizing the expected change in this utility function also
optimizes time-average growth under the corresponding dy-
namic (Eq. 30). An unusual utility function – like the convex
function shown here – reﬂects unusual dynamics, see text.

the wealth distribution, (Eq. 37). This distribution is gener-

t = 5, and we use au = 1/2, bu = 1, and C = 0.
VII.
UNBOUNDEDNESS OF u(x)
The scheme outlined in Section V is informative for the
debate regarding the boundedness of utility functions. A
well-established but false belief in the economics liter-
ature, due to Karl Menger [10, 11], is that permissible
utility functions must be bounded. We have argued pre-
viously that boundedness is an unnecessary restriction,


--- Page 8 ---

and that Menger’s arguments are not valid [12, 14]. Sec-
tion V implies that the interpretation of expected utility
theory we oﬀer here formally requires unboundedness of
utility functions. Bounded functions are not invertible,
and Menger’s incorrect result therefore contributed to
obscuring the simple natural arguments we present here.
Of course whether u(x) is bounded or not is practically
irrelevant because x will always be ﬁnite. However, for
a clean mathematical formalism an unbounded u(x) is
highly desirable.
The problem is easily demonstrated by considering the
case of zero noise. Since u(x) always follows a Brownian
motion in our treatment, in the zero-noise case it follows
du = audt,
(38)
meaning linear growth in time.
For u to be bounded,
time itself would have to be bounded. Another way to
see the problem is inverting u(x) to ﬁnd x(u).
If we
require simultaneously linear growth of u(t) in time, and
boundedness from above, limx→∞u(x) = Ub, then x(t)
has to diverge in the ﬁnite time it takes for u(t) to reach
Ub, namely in Tb =
Ub
au (assuming for simplicity u(t =
0) = 0).
Such features – an end of time or a ﬁnite-time singu-
larity of wealth – are inconvenient to carry around in
a formalism. Since they have no physical meaning, for
simplicity a model without them should be chosen, i.e.
unbounded utility functions will be much better. We re-
peat that Menger’s arguments against unbounded utility
functions are invalid and we need not worry about them.
VIII.
DISCUSSION
EUT is an 18th-century patch, applied to a ﬂawed con-
ceptual framework established in the 17th century that
made blatantly wrong predictions of human behavior.
Because the mathematics of randomness was in its in-
fancy in the 18th century, the conceptual problems were
overlooked, and utility theory set economics oﬀin the
wrong direction. Without any of the arbitrariness inher-
ent in utility functions it is nowadays possible to give a
physical meaning to the non-linear mappings people seem
to apply to monetary amounts.
These apparent map-
pings simply encode the non-linearity of wealth dyan-
mics.
