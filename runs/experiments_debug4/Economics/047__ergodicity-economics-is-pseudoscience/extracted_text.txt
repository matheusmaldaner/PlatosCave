Quantum propensity in economics

Abstract: This paper describes an approach to economics that is inspired by quantum computing, 
and is motivated by the need to develop a consistent quantum mathematical framework for 
economics. The traditional neoclassical approach assumes that rational utility-optimisers drive 
market prices to a stable equilibrium, subject to external perturbations. While this approach has 
been highly influential, it has come under increasing criticism following the financial crisis of 
2007/8. The quantum approach, in contrast, is inherently probabilistic and dynamic. Decision-
makers are described, not by a utility function, but by a propensity function which specifies the 
probability of transacting. We show how a number of cognitive phenomena such as preference 
reversal and the disjunction effect can be modelled by using a simple quantum circuit to generate 
an appropriate propensity function. Conversely, a general propensity function can be quantized to 
incorporate effects such as interference and entanglement that characterise human decision-
making. Applications to some common problems in economics and finance are discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
Theories of economics always rely on theories of value. In classical economics, it was assumed 
that value is the product of labour (Smith, 1776). A problem of course is that labour is difficult to 
measure, and the link with value is not always clear. This became obvious with the development 
of sophisticated financial markets in the late nineteenth century, where prices for something like a

share in a railway company didn’t directly reflect human labour. Neoclassical economists reacted 
by substituting labour with utility, which had been defined by Bentham in his 1789 Principles of 
Morals and Legislation as that which appears to “augment or diminish the happiness of the party 
whose interest is in question.” 
 
As with labour, utility seemed hard to measure directly, but as Jevons pointed out in his Theory of 
Political Economy (1871), another approach was to simply assume that utility was reflected by 
price. While this turned utility into a somewhat circular concept (Robinson, 1962), it did seem to 
hold out the possibility that economics could be put on a rational scientific basis; a task eventually 
undertaken by Von Neumann and Morgenstern, whose Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour 
(1944) developed a consistent set of axioms to describe rational economic behaviour based on a 
theory of expected utility. 
 
The assumption that people act rationally to optimise their own utility became the basis for 
economics as it developed in the post-war era. However while this model of rational economic 
behaviour remains the default approach in economics, cognitive psychologists have shown that its 
assumptions are often violated. For example, one of the key axioms of expected utility theory is 
that people have fixed preferences. Yet the widely-demonstrated phenomenon of preference 
reversal shows that in fact people do not have stable preferences and have a tendency to change 
their mind depending on things like context (Tversky and Thaler, 1990). 
 
The belief that rational utility-optimisers drive prices to a stable equilibrium was also sorely tested 
by the financial crisis of 2007/8. In response to that crisis, economists began to adopt methods 
from behavioural economics, in which so-called cognitive anomalies were accommodated by 
modifying the utility function to account for effects such as loss aversion or herd behaviour 
(Kahneman, 2011). As discussed below, though, a range of cognitive phenomena continue to elude 
behavioural approaches, because they do not conform to classical logic (Wendt, 2015). This has 
motivated interest in adopting a mathematical framework based on quantum probability.  
 
Quantum probability is a set of mathematical rules to calculate probabilities of events in quantum 
mechanics. Its properties such as nonadditivity and noncommutativity make it well-suited to model

uncertainty in decision-making behavior in social sciences, particularly in economics and more 
generally human cognition where it extends classical utility theory (Qadir, 1978; Segal, 1998; 
Baaquie, 2004; Derman, 2004; Busemeyer and Bruza, 2012; Haven and Khrennikov, 2013). The 
approach known as quantum decision theory, first proposed in (Yukalov and Sornette, 2008), 
provides a framework for modeling and predicting human decisions, that can be used to explain 
many behavioural phenomena which are unaccounted by utility-theoretic approaches. Quantum 
decision theory allows us to characterize the rational–irrational dual behavior of real decision 
makers, who evaluate not only the utility of the given prospects, but also their respective 
attractiveness. In (Yukalov and Sornette, 2014) and (Yukalov and Sornette, 2015), the lotteries 
consisting only of gains are considered, then the idea is extended to lotteries with both gain and 
loss (Yukalov and Sornette, 2017). In (Zhang, C. and Kjellström, 2021) multi-modal attraction 
factor function that take multiple emotional and cognitive items into account are considered. 
  
The approach in this paper is to generalize the quantum approach, by modelling economic 
decision-making using a probabilistic propensity function that can be expressed in quantum terms. 
In other words, we model the economy in a manner consistent with, and inspired, by quantum 
computing (Nielsen and Chuang, 2002; Nakahara M and Ohmi T, 2008). The plan of the remainder 
of the paper is as follows. Section 2 motivates the use of quantum probability to model economic 
decisions. Section 3 shows how a simple quantum circuit, of a sort commonly used in quantum 
algorithms, can simulate a variety of cognitive phenomena which elude a classical approach. 
Section 4 shows how a general propensity function can be quantized to yield the quantum 
dynamics of financial transactions. Finally Section 5 summarises the main results. 
 
2. Quantum probability 
 
The key difference between quantum computers and classical computers is that, instead of storing 
information in binary bits which can take on the value 0 and 1, quantum computers use qubits, 
which randomly collapse to a particular state when measured. Quantum computers are therefore 
inherently probabilistic rather than deterministic, so a quantum circuit may have to be run and 
measured many times in order to build up a statistical estimate to a solution. Probabilities of 


--- Page 4 ---

quantum measurements are modelled by a 2-norm (which involves a sum of squares) rather than a 
1-norm.  
 
In order to motivate, from first principles, the use of quantum probability in a social context, 
suppose that we wish to model the state of a person who is going to make a binary choice between 
two options. If the person is equally likely to choose either, then the situation is the same as for a 
random coin toss. In general, the state could be modelled by the diagonal ray in Figure 1.A, where 
two dimensions are required because we want to capture the possibility of either outcome. If the 
ray has length 1, and we associate the probabilities of obtaining heads or tails by taking the square, 
i.e. the 2-norm, of the projections onto the respective axis, then the probabilities add to 1 as 
expected. 
 
 
 
  
Figure 1. A) A coin toss for a balanced coin can be expressed as a superposition of two states, 
heads and tails. B) because the 2-norm of a probability is its square, we can also consider negative 
projections. C) Applying the Hadamard transformation rotates S1 by 45 degrees clockwise which 
aligns with the H axis (S3). The ray H3 (the rotated version of H1) can be viewed as a superposition 
of horizontal and vertical parts (not shown), and the same for T3 (the rotated version of T1); 
however the vertical parts now cancel out, leaving only a horizontal ray S3. 
 
The state can therefore be interpreted as a propensity to give different outcomes, in this case heads 
or tails. Because the 2-norm of a probability depends on the square, one can also imagine cases 
where the projections are negative (Haug, 2004; Aaronson, 2013). For example, in Figure 1.B the 


--- Page 5 ---
5 
 
projection on the heads axis is negative, but the 2-norm of the probability is unchanged. Since 
negative numbers are allowed, the need for mathematical closure suggests that complex numbers 
should be as well, for example to accommodate situations where we need to calculate square roots 
(Aaronson, 2013). 
 
Suppose now that we apply a unitary (and so norm-preserving) transformation, known as the 
Hadamard transformation, which rotates S1 by 45 degrees clockwise. A coin in the superposed 
state of Figure 1.A will then be rotated so that it aligns with the H axis, as in Figure 1.C, which 
means that when measured it will be Heads for sure. The indeterminate system has become 
deterministic. Another way to think about this is to recall that the initial propensity state is a 
superposition of two orthogonal states, denoted H1 and T1 in the figure. After being rotated, T1 
leads to T3 and H1 leads to H3. The T3 ray has a positive heads and a positive tails component. 
However the H3 ray has a positive heads and a negative tails. The positive and negative tails 
components therefore cancel out, leaving only the positive heads components. This is an example 
of interference, which again occurs because the 2-norm allows negative terms. 
 
Finally, we can also ask what happens when we have a more complicated system, for example two 
coins instead of one. The possible final outcomes are then HH, HT, TH, and TT, where HT is 
heads for the first coin and tails for the second, and so on. But now, representing the superposed 
state of the system is considerably more complicated, because instead of just needing two axes, H 
and T, we now need four axes: HH, HT, TH and TT. For some situations, it is possible to treat 
each coin separately, which would allow us to represent our information about each one in its own 
two-dimensional figure; but if say the system is in a balanced superposition of HH and TT – i.e. 
there is an equal probability of getting either both heads, or both tails, and those are the only 
possibilities – then we say that the coins are entangled. Entanglement can therefore be viewed as 
a particular kind of superposed state, which leads to correlation in measurement probabilities of 
subsystems.  
 
The adoption of the 2-norm as a probabilistic measure therefore models the related phenomena of 
superposition, interference, and entanglement, which are characteristic of quantum systems, and 
are exploited in quantum computers to give significant computational advantages over classical

computers (Aaronson, 2013). In a quantum computer, the coin toss would be modelled using the 
wave function |𝜓〉 of a single qubit, which is in a superposition of two basis states |0〉= (1
0) and 
|1〉= (0
1), with the first representing heads and the second representing tails. We can then write 
|𝜓〉= 𝑎0|0〉+ 𝑎1|1〉= (𝑎0
𝑎1) 
where 𝑎0 and 𝑎1 are complex numbers with |𝑎0|2 + |𝑎1|2 = 1. When measured in the 
computational basis, the possible outcomes are |0〉 with a probability |𝑎0|2 and |1〉 with a 
probability |𝑎1|2. Quantum gates which produce transformations are represented by unitary 
matrices, and two or more qubits are represented by tensor products, as seen below.  
 
To summarise, classical probability is the simplest kind of probability, which is based on the 1-
norm and involves positive numbers. The next-simplest kind of probability uses the 2-norm, and 
includes complex numbers. The reason this kind of probability is called quantum probability, is 
for the historical reason that it turns out to be the right framework for quantum physics, and is the 
basis of quantum computing; however there is no reason we can’t apply it to other areas, such as 
economics. 
 
3. Quantum circuits 
 
Quantum probability has been adopted in areas such as quantum cognition and quantum game 
theory because it naturally accounts for effects such as interference and entanglement (Busemeyer 
and Bruza, 2012; Wendt, 2015; Haven et al, 2018). Well-known examples from the quantum 
cognition literature include the order effect, where responses to questions in a survey depend on 
the order in which they are asked; the disjunction effect, where extra information seems to interfere 
with decision-making in a manner that eludes classical logic; preference reversal, where a decision 
changes depending on context; or games such as the prisoner’s dilemma, where experiments show 
that people behave not as individual utility-optimisers, but as people who are entangled through 
things like a social contract. 
 
For the order effect, the usual way to think about this is in terms of a sequence of projections, as 
illustrated in Figure 2. If question A is followed by question B, and we assume that the questions 


--- Page 7 ---
7 
 
have yes/no responses, then the first response is modelled by collapsing the state, shown by the 
diagonal grey line, onto one of the two axes labelled “A yes” or “A no”. That state is then used as 
the starting point for a projection onto the B axes. The probabilities of the possible outcomes when 
question A is asked first are as shown in Table 1. Similar calculations can be made with the order 
reversed to reveal the order effect, which has been demonstrated in a broad range of empirical 
studies (Wang et al, 2014). The probability of outcomes when question A is followed by question 
B and vice versa are shown in Table 2.

An equivalent representation of this sequence, based on the methods of quantum computing, is the 
quantum circuit shown in Figure 3. The input on the left is two qubits, each of which is initialised 
to |0〉. The joint initial state is written 
𝜓0 = |00〉= (1
0) ⊗(1
0) = (
1
0
0
0
). 
The top qubit is acted on by the gate A, which is a rotation matrix of the form 
𝐴= 𝑅𝜃= (cos 𝜃
−sin 𝜃
sin 𝜃
cos 𝜃). 
The lower qubit is acted on by the similar rotation matrix 𝐵= 𝑅𝜑 where 𝜑 represents the 
difference in the frameworks used to answer the two questions. The two qubits are then entangled 
through a C-NOT gate, which is represented by the matrix 
𝑋𝑐= (
1

).

The operation 𝜓𝑓= 𝑋𝑐(𝐴⊗𝐵)𝜓0 depicted in Figure 3 then yields the same output probabilities 
for the possible states as in Table 1. Similar calculations can be made with the order of questions 
reversed, by inverting the C-NOT gate so that the second qubit acts as the control and updating 𝐴 
as 𝑅𝜑 and 𝐵 as 𝑅(𝜃−𝜑). 
 
 
Figure 3. Quantum circuit for a decision B influenced by a context A. 
 
As seen in the Appendix, this relationship holds when gates A and B are arbitrary unitary matrices, 
so the circuit is quite flexible and can be used to simulate any problem that can be described either 
by a sequence of projections, as in quantum cognition, or by an entangled system as in quantum 
decision theory (Yukalov and Sornette, 2015). For the disjunction effect (Blutner and Graben, 
2016), gate A represents a context or a piece of information, while gate B represents a decision. 
For preference reversal (Yukalov and Sornette, 2015), gate A represents a subjective context, while 
gate B represents an objective utility such as a monetary award. The circuit can also be used to 
simulate a version of the prisoner’s dilemma, where gate B represents one player’s strategy, and 
gate A represents their ideas about the other player’s strategy (Orrell, 2020b). 
 
A particularly strong, and economically relevant, example of a quantum social phenomenon is the 
existence of threshold effects. For the case of preference reversal, if the context-dependent 
subjective factors represented by gate A are assumed to be random, then they can be expected to 
have a roughly equal effect as the objective factors (such as the prize in a lottery) represented by 
gate B. Because changes in context often have a switch-like nature (for example, a person may or 
may not have a particular piece of information or experience a particular event) the result is a kind 
of threshold effect, where objective costs are balanced by subjective factors which can suddenly 
change. According to the preference reversal criterion (Yukalov and Sornette, 2018), if the less 
attractive option has an associated cost 𝑥1 and the more attractive option has a cost 𝑥2, then a 


--- Page 10 ---
10 
 
switch from the more attractive to the less attractive option will only occur if 𝑥2 𝑥1
⁄
> 3. This 
criterion has been empirically tested in a range of experiments, and appears to be quite robust 
(Yukalov and Sornette, 2015; 2018; Orrell, 2021a). We return to the question of threshold effects 
below. 
 
4. Propensity and entropic force 
 
The above examples show that the quantum approach, native to quantum computers, is well-suited 
to studying a variety of problems that involve interference and entanglement, and are therefore not 
easily addressed using classical logic or behavioural approaches, which is why quantum methods 
are seeing increasing use in the social sciences (Wendt, 2015; Der Derian and Wendt, 2020). For 
the case of economics the quantum approach, with its change from utility to propensity, also leads 
to a shift in our understanding of how decisions are made, and how financial transactions are 
modelled.  
 
Smith (1776) argued that the “propensity to truck, barter, and exchange” was inherent in human 
nature – and while we can’t directly observe utility, we can certainly observe people buying and 
selling. We can therefore define a propensity function as a kind of schedule which describes the 
probability that a person will take a certain decision. Similar propensity curves are used in 
marketing, where the technique known as “propensity modelling” is used to simulate how a 
customer’s willingness to buy is affected by attributes including price (Wilcox, n.d.). Since as we 
have seen quantum probability can be used to derive a propensity function for the discrete case, a 
natural question to ask is whether it is possible to go the other way, and use a given propensity 
function to derive a quantum model. 
 
As an example, suppose that we made a probabilistic estimate of the price of a house. The result 
could resemble a normal distribution, as in Figure 4, where the center of the distribution would be 
our best estimate, while the standard deviation would be a measure of our uncertainty. In quantum 
terms, this can be interpreted as a superposition state, where the chance of selecting a particular 
price depends on the squared amplitude of an underlying wave function. The situation is therefore 


--- Page 11 ---
11 
 
similar to the coin toss, except that instead of only heads or tails there is now a continuous range 
of possible outcomes.  
 
 
Figure 4. The curves show propensity as a function of price, measured in millions of dollars. Both 
are centered at P = 1, but the panel on the right has a higher level of price flexibility. The arrows 
indicate the strength and direction of the associated entropic forces (discussed later). 
 
While it is traditional in economics to talk about the forces of supply and demand, these forces are 
assumed to cancel at equilibrium, and there is no consistent concept of economic mass. The 
dynamics of economic transactions are therefore not usually considered in detail, other than to 
assume the system is at balance. In contrast, an advantage of the propensity framework is that it 
leads to the concept of entropic force, which reflects the tendency of a system to achieve maximum 
entropy (Sokolov, 2010; Caticha, 2019). In statistical physics, an entropic force for a probability 
distribution 𝑃(𝑥) is given by 
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝛾𝑃′(𝑥)
𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑃′(𝑥)
𝑃(𝑥) 
where 𝑇 is temperature and 𝑘𝐵 is the Boltzmann constant. In economics, the propensity can 
similarly be viewed as the product of an entropic force acting on the mental state of the 
buyer/seller; and 𝛾 can be interpreted as a kind of energy which is related to information (Orrell, 
2020a). 
 
As an example, suppose a propensity function 𝑃(𝑥) is normal with mean 𝜇 and standard 
deviation 𝜎, where price 𝑥 is a logarithmic variable. Then the corresponding entropic force is 


--- Page 12 ---
12 
 
𝐹(𝑥) = 𝛾𝑃′(𝑥)
𝑃(𝑥) = −𝑘(𝑥−𝜇) 
where 𝑘= 𝛾𝜎2
⁄
 is a force constant. The linear force, which is the same as that of a spring, 
therefore represents the mental desire for a buyer or seller to adjust the price to their own preferred 
level.  
 
While the entropic force allows us to interpret the system in terms of dynamics, it doesn’t tell us 
anything about the relevant mass that the force acts on; and as already seen we want to be able to 
account for effects such as interference and entanglement. We can address these issues by again 
moving to a quantum framework, and viewing the propensity function as being the product of an 
underlying wave function. The quantum version of a spring system is the quantum harmonic 
oscillator. This has a ground state whose corresponding probability distribution for position x is a 
normal distribution with mean 𝜇 and standard deviation 𝜎. The associated mass is 
𝑚= 
ℏ
2𝜔𝜎2 
so mass varies inversely with variance. Referring to Figure 4, the narrow propensity curve on the 
left has a higher associated mass than does the wider curve on the right. The scaling factor 𝛾 is 
given by 𝛾= ℏ𝜔2
⁄  which has units of energy. 
 
In statistical physics, a frequency 𝜈 is related to the inverse of the Boltzmann time 𝜏𝐵= ℏ(𝑘𝐵𝑇)
⁄
 
which is the theoretical order of time needed for an arbitrary nonstationary state to reach thermal 
equilibrium (Goldstein, Hara, and Tasaki, 2015). In the social version, the frequency can therefore 
be thought of as representing a linearised resistance to change. For something like a stock market, 
the frequency can be used to represent the speed of mean reversion of returns (Ahn et al, 2017). 
 
In an economic transaction, the buyer propensity function will normally have a higher mean price 
than that of the seller, so the only parts of these curves which will be active are near the mid-price, 
as illustrated in Figure 5. It is easily checked that the joint propensity function, which is the product 
of the buyer and seller propensities, is a scaled normal curve and has an entropic force which is 
just the sum of the buyer and seller forces. The case where the supplier fixes the price and refuses 
to negotiate is handled by assuming an infinitely thin propensity curve located at the sale price.

the joint propensity. 
 
Because the oscillator model is inherently probabilistic, it can be used to model features such as 
the statistics of financial markets, and the pricing and volume of financial options (Orrell, 2020a; 
2021). Another difference between quantum and classical oscillators is that the former features 
discrete energy levels. The ground state, which again can be viewed as representing the potential 
for a transaction to occur, corresponds to the normal distribution, while the other states show more 
complicated distributions, and contribute the non-normal behavior also seen with markets (Ahn et 
al, 2017). 
 
A main advantage of the quantum approach, when coupled with the entropic approach, is therefore 
that it gives us a consistent set of equations and units with which we can describe the dynamics of 
the system; and is particularly well adapted to the study of financial transactions, which involve 
the flow of information rather than just physical objects. For example, returning to the general case 
where the entropic force is given by  
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝛾𝑃′(𝑥)
𝑃(𝑥) 
we can look at a particular mental state where the log price is 𝑥1 and ask how much work – which 
again is linked to information – must be done against the entropic force to move to another state 
𝑥2. This is simply 


--- Page 14 ---
14 
 
∆𝐸= ∫
𝐹(𝑥)
𝑥2
𝑥1
𝑑𝑥= 𝛾log (𝑃(𝑥2)
𝑃(𝑥1)) 
which depends only on the ratio of the initial and final propensities. The change in propensity 
required for preference reversal, as mentioned above, is typically a factor 3, which is close to 
Euler’s number. It follows that what might be called the energy or information required to change 
a person’s mind is 
∆𝐸= ℏ𝜔
2 log(3) ≅ℏ𝜔
2 log(𝑒) = ℏ𝜔
2  
which is the base energy of a quantum oscillator. In a quantum computer, it is also the order of 
energy needed to flip a qubit from one state to another. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In early neoclassical economics, utility was viewed as a kind of energy. In his 1892 book 
Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices, Irving Fisher for example 
expressed economic transactions in physical terms, where utility had units of energy. The quantum 
framework returns to this idea of energy, but associates it with a change in propensity rather than 
a utility. While previous works have demonstrated the usefulness of quantum methods in 
modelling cognitive phenomena, the propensity approach allows us to view economic transactions 
in general as a quantized probabilistic system, of the sort simulated in quantum computing. 
 
Of course, many social scientists will argue that it is inappropriate to quantify things like social 
power or mental energy, since they cannot be reduced to exact equations. However one 
consequence of the rational utility-optimizing picture is that complex social topics such as power 
relationships were downplayed or ignored (Häring and Douglas, 2013; Orrell, 2017).3 Since 
economics is a quantitative discipline, we need a suitable framework with which to describe the 
interplay between objective and subjective forces that make up power. 
 
                                                          
3 The topic of power receives more attention from heterodox economists. For example the “capital as 
power” approach of Nitzan and Bichler (2009) sees money and capital as manifestations of power, but 
does not attempt to quantify power directly. 


--- Page 15 ---
15 
 
A main contribution of the quantum approach is to connect power with propensity. While human 
motivations cannot be reduced to equations, it seems reasonable to quantify the propensity for a 
person to make a particular decision (indeed, this is the entire basis for fields such as behavioural 
economics). The entropic force (along with its associated energy) is merely another way of 
expressing a propensity function. The approach can be used to simulate a variety of economic 
phenomena, from cognitive interference in the decision-making process, to the price of financial 
options. 
 
To summarise, neoclassical economics was marked by a switch from a labour theory of value, to 
one based on utility. Quantum economics makes a similar switch, by expressing value in terms of 
a propensity function. Adopting a quantum probabilistic framework allows us to incorporate 
cognitive effects such as interference and entanglement; express basic economic quantities such 
as forces of supply and demand in consistent units; and consider both subjective and objective 
factors on an equal footing. 
 
Appendix 
 
Each measurement in a non-computational basis is equivalent to applying a unitary matrix and 
then measuring in the computational basis (Nielsen, 2002). It follows that the circuit in Figure 2 is 
equivalent to Figure A.1, where A = [a11
a12
a21
a22] and B = [b11
b12
b21
b22] are unitary matrices 
determined based on the given non-computational basis. This Appendix shows how this one-qubit 
circuit is equivalent to the two-qubit quantum circuit depicted in Figure 3 for the general case 
where A and B are unitary matrices.

“Yes” to the first question, and 𝐴− would correspond to answering “No”. 
 
If EVENT 𝐴+ happens, then the output state after applying 𝐵 is 𝐵|0⟩= [𝑏11
𝑏21]. The second 
measurement collapses the state to |0⟩ with probability equal to |𝑏11|2 (EVENT 𝐵+) and collapses 
to |1⟩ with probability equal to |𝑏21|2 (EVENT 𝐵−).  
 
With the same argument for the other path we have: 
 
EVENTS 
𝐴+𝐵+ 
𝐴+𝐵− 
𝐴−𝐵+ 
𝐴−𝐵−

Probability 
|𝑎11𝑏11|2 
|𝑎11𝑏21|2 
|𝑎21𝑏12|2 
|𝑎21𝑏22|2 
 
On the other hand the output of the two-qubit circuit, when the control qubit is at the top of the 
circuit, is 𝑎11𝑏11|00⟩+ 𝑎11𝑏21|01⟩+ 𝑎21𝑏21|10⟩+ 𝑎21𝑏11|11⟩ with associated probabilities:

Since 𝐵 is unitary, its columns (or its rows) form an orthonormal basis (Steeb, 2006). In the case 
of a 2-by-2 unitary matrix, |𝑏11|2 + |𝑏12|2 = |𝑏11|2 + |𝑏21|2 = 1 which implies |𝑏12|2 = |𝑏21|2, 
and |𝑏11|2 + |𝑏21|2 = |𝑏21|2 + |𝑏22|2 = 1 which implies |𝑏11|2 = |𝑏22|2. It therefore follows that 
the final probabilities for the two circuits are the same. (Note that the intermediate probabilities 
are not the same.)
