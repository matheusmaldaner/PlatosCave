ABSTRACT 
The high-dimensional text data always contains a large quantity of 
noisy terms which bring negative effects on the performance of 
text classification. Feature selection is the common solution for 
dimension reduction in text classification. The choices of feature 
selection methods for text classification have significant impacts 
on classification accuracy. According to our literature review, few 
recent studies of feature selection focus on performance 
comparisons on feature selection methods. To fill this gap, this 
paper conducts discussions to compare performances of typical 
feature selection methods which are commonly involved in 
previous studies for text classification. Firstly, we introduce and 
discuss a series of typical feature selection methods in previous 
studies for text classification in details. Secondly, we conduct 
comparison experiments on four benchmark datasets to compare 
the effectiveness of twenty typical feature selection methods in 
text classification. Finally, we give conclusions on performance of 
the typical feature selection methods. The result of this paper 
gives a guideline for selecting appropriate feature selection 
methods for text classification academic analysis or real-world 
text classification applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Text classification (TC) is one of the most important subfields of 
text mining. TC aims to attach pre-defined class labels to text 
documents with unknown classes for further mining of 
commercial value and practical meaning of text. TS has been 
involved in various practical tasks, such as the analysis of public 
opinion [1] and security [2], the applications of business [3], 
education [4] and social media [5]. 
The performance of TC models is significantly affected by the 
quality of text data. However, the high-dimensional text data 
always contains a lot of noisy terms. These noisy terms bring 
negative effects on performance of the classification models. 
Recently, many researchers have made efforts to design more 
precise TC models, including improved traditional models [6], 
models based on deep neural networks [7] and hybrid models 
combining traditional and deep learning models [8].These 
improved models are still unable to avoid the negative effects 
because noisy terms are still taken advantages of in the training 
process. Feature selection (FS) is one of the solutions to ease the 
negative effects of noisy terms on performance of TC. Generally, 
FS is the technique to select effective features from a large 
quantity of coordinate features of target data. In text domain, FS 
can be used to select informative terms for the training of 
classification models. FS is beneficial for the improvement of TC 
accuracy because it decreases the proportion of noisy terms and 
increases the proportion of informative terms. The negative effects 
of noisy terms on TC can be reduced by FS. 
A lot of FS methods have been proposed for TC. However, few 
researches have discussed the different performances of FS 
methods in TC. A systematic comparison of FS methods for TC is 
of academic and practical values: (1) researchers are able to 
choose appropriate FS methods for their studies on TC so that 
quality of their experiments can be improved. (2) TC applications 
in real-world scenarios can be improved by better classification 
accuracy caused by FS. According to our literature reviews of FS, 
few recent studies focus on performance comparison on FS 
methods. To fill this gap, we conduct systematic summarization 
and discussion on FS methods. Firstly, we summarize the typical 
FS methods for text classification. Typical FS methods are 
commonly involved in previous researches. Secondly, we 
compare the different performance of these methods by 
conducting comparative experiments on benchmark datasets. 
Finally, we give conclusions on performance of the typical feature 
selection methods. 
The contribution of this paper is the systematic comparison on 
performance of commonly used FS methods for TC. We provide a 
comprehensive summarization on typical FS methods in previous 
researches and discuss the performance of these FS methods 
experimentally. According to our literature review, few recent 
researches cover comparisons on FS methods. The result of our 
paper gives a guideline for other researchers (or users) to select 
appropriate FS methods for academic TC tasks (or real-world TC 
applications).

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Recent researches focus on developing effective FS methods for 
text classification. 
Some researchers develop FS methods based optimization 
techniques. Most of these methods are developed according to 
evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization 
(PSO), genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization. Lee et al. 
(2019a) [9] presented a method based on PSO. In this method, 
term subset was modified according to effectiveness by the 
selected operator to solve the problem of degenerated term subsets. 
Kushwaha and Pant (2018) [10] presented an improved PSO 
based FS method. The method updated particles according to 
neighbor best position to extend the limitation of traditional global 
best updating strategy. Abualigah and Khader (2017) [11] 
developed a hybrid method by integrating PSO with genetic 
algorithm and k-means clustering. The k-means clustering is used 
for evaluating the quality of the term subset. Onan and Korukoglu 
(2017) [12] introduced an ensemble FS method. The method 
created term subsets by using different other FS methods. Genetic 
algorithm is applied to aggregate these term subsets. Ahmad et al. 
(2019) [13] introduced a FS method based on ant colony 
optimization algorithm.The method used k-nearest neighbor to 
generate the final term subset. Based on other optimization 
algorithm, Huang et al. (2019) [14] used the concept of multiple 
objectives optimization for FS. The proposed methodwas able to 
achieve the best number of terms automatically. Moreover, the 
authors developed a parallel algorithm to lower the computational 
cost of optimization process. 
There 
are 
researches 
on 
FS 
methods 
which 
select 
discriminative terms according to frequency information of 
text directly. Kim and Zzang (2019) [15] presented a FS method 
to emphasize the use of relative document frequencies. The 
method selected discriminative terms according to true positive 
rate and false positive rate. Lee et al. (2019b) [16] proposed a new 
memetic FS method to solve the problem that conventional 
memetic FS methods was limited to use ineffective feature filter 
to achieve term subsets with low accuracy. Shain and Kilic (2019) 
[17] proposed two modified FS methods. One of the two methods 
was developed by employing new parameters to the original 
Relevance Frequency method. Another method was achieved by 
changing parameters of the traditional Accuracy2 method. Labani 
et al. (2018) [18] proposed a FS method which focused on both 
redundancy and relevancy of terms. The method reduced 
redundant terms and then evaluated redundancy between terms 
according to their correlations. Rehman et al. (2017) [19] 
presented an improved method which considered relative 
document frequencies. The proposal the method aimed to solve 
the problem that ACC2 method assigned equal rankings to terms 
with equal difference calculating by frequencies in positive and 
negative classes. 
Information theory is also used by researchers to design FS 
methods. Tang et al. (2019) [20] decomposed the problem of FS 
based on mutual information to a sum of low-order interactions 
and then employed the five-dimensional joint mutual information 
to estimate the interaction terms. Li et al. (2017) [21] presented a 
FS method based on information theory. The method used mutual 
information based on Renyi entropy to evaluated relationships 
between terms and class labels. The discriminative term subset 
was created by maximum mutual information. 
Theories of economy and neural science can also be used for 
designing FS methods. Wang et al. (2019) [22] proposed a FS 
based on utility, an economic concept. The method selected 
discriminative terms by measuring the usefulness terms.The 
useful terms werehelpful for authors to express their main ideas. 
Wang and Hong (2019) [23] applied the Hebb rule to develop a 
FS method for TC. The method treated terms and class labels as 
neurons and select effective terms according to the strength of 
relationships between terms and class labels. 
This paper is motivated by the following two observations 
according to literature review in this section. 
Observation 1: In recent researches, typical FS methods are 
involved as benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of the 
proposed methods. However, the comparison experiments only 
cover a few typical FS methods. A systematic comparison on 
performance of typical FS methods can provide researchers a 
guideline to select benchmark FS methods to better illustrate their 
experimental results in order to achieve more persuasive 
conclusion. 
Observation 2: The recently proposed FS methods have not been 
compared in various text domains. The effectiveness of these 
methods remains to be further evaluated. On the contrary, the 
typical FS methods are commonly used in TC tasks or as 
benchmarks in previous studies. The performances of these typical 
FS methods have been evaluated by various studies in many text 
domains. The performances of typical FS methods in TC are more 
reliable. However, recent studies do not cover the systematic 
comparison on many typical FS methods.  
In this paper, we try to conduct systematic comparison 
experiments 
to 
provide 
a 
comprehensive 
research 
on 
performances of typical FS methods in TC. We do our best to 
cover as many typical FS methods as possible. Moreover, we try 
to use more reliable datasets which have been involved in publish 
papers and covers various text domains. 
3. TYPICAL FS METHODS 
This section introduces and discusses typical FS methods. These 
methods are either supervised or unsupervised. Supervised 
methods take advantages of class information during FS process 
while unsupervised methods ignore class information. 
Before text classification, unstructured text data is commonly 
transformed into a structured matrix termed document-term matrix 
(DTM. The general form of the 𝑛× 𝑚 DTM is shown in Figure 1. 
The 𝑖th row 𝑑𝑖 represents the 𝑖th text document (𝑖= 1,2, ⋯, 𝑛). 
The 𝑗th column 𝑡𝑗represents the 𝑗th term in the 𝑛 text documents 
(𝑗= 1,2, ⋯, 𝑚). The (𝑖, 𝑗) element 𝑡𝑖𝑗 represents term frequency 
of 𝑡𝑗in 𝑑𝑖.

3.2 Unsupervised Methods 
Unsupervised methods select informative terms by measuring 
frequency statistical characteristics. 
Document frequency (DF) assumes that effective terms should 
exist in many text documents. DF is given by Formula (16).

Mean median (MM) measures information of a term by the 
difference between its arithmetic mean (𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛(𝑡𝑗)) and median 
(𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝑡𝑗)). MM is given by Formula (18). 
𝑀𝑀(𝑡𝑗) = |𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛(𝑡𝑗) −𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝑡𝑗)|                      (18)

4. EXPERIMENTS 
4.1 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics 
Four datasets achieved from the UCI repository are used in our 
comparison experiments. The four datasets are named as CARR, 
COMD, IMDB, and KDCN respectively. The CARR dataset 
contains user reviews on various kinds of cars of a famous brand. 
The COMD dataset is made up of textual business descriptions on 
Brazilian companies of nine classes. The IMDB dataset contains 
positive and negative movie reviews. The KDCN dataset contains 
manyTurkish news. The quality of our comparison experiments 
can be guaranteed because the four selected datasets cover various 
domains such as cars, companies, movies as well as news, and 
moreover, they have been involved in published papers of several 
text mining tasks. 
Decision tree (DT) which has been successfully involved in 
various TC domains is chosen as the classifier for our experiments. 
The commonly used classification accuracy is used to measure 
performance of DT classifier to compare performance of FS 
methods. 10-fold cross validation is used to provide more 
robustexperimental results. 
4.2 Experimental Results 
The experimental results of DT classification accuracies are 
shown in Figure 2 to 5. DT classifiers are trained under the 
84


--- Page 5 ---
different numbers (the numbers of the X axis) of selected terms. 
The following conclusions can be draw according to experimental 
results. 
(1) IGI, MOR and MC-OR performs the best among all the 
methods. Moreover, there are not significant differences 
between classification accuracies of MOR and MC-OR. The 
ranking is MOR = MC-OR > IGI. 
(2) TV, TVQ, TF and DF achieve relatively good performance. 
According to the classification accuracies, the general 
ranking of the four methods are TV > TVQ > TF > DF. 
However, TVQ performs the best among all the methods in 
the IMDB dataset. 
(3) The three versions of CHI achieve relatively good 
performance. Classification accuracies of the three versions 
are not significant different. 
(4) ECE performs well in most of the cases. However, it is unable 
to achieve good classification accuracies for small numbers 
(e.g. 20, 50) of selection terms 
(5) The performances of AMGM, MM and MAD are not stable in 
the four datasets. Performances of AMGM in the KDCN 
dataset are much worse than its performances in other 
datasets. Similar to AMGM, MM and MAD do not perform 
well in the CARR dataset, according to the comparisons on 
their performances in other datasets. 
(6) IG, GI and MI achieve the worst classification accuracy 
among all the methods. Moreover, the maximum version of 
MI is better than its average version. 
(7) General performances of EOR and WOR are followed by 
performances of IG, GI and MI. 
 
Figure 2. Experimental results of the CARR dataset

Figure 4. Experimental Results of the IMDB dataset 
 
Figure 5. Experimental Results of the KDCN dataset 
According to the above discussions, MOR and MC-OR are both 
the best choice of FS method for TC. However, their formulas are 
relatively complicated among all the methods. In addition, IGI are 
the ideal candidate FS methods. On the one hand, IGI performs 
well in the comparison experiments. On the other hand, the 
formula of IGI is relatively simple and convenient to be 
implemented by computer programs. Although MOR, MC-OR 
and IGI perform well in TC tasks, they are necessary to calculate 
distributions between terms and classes. Compared with TV, TVQ, 
TF and DF, the above three supervised methods are necessary to 
calculate probability of terms and classes, resulting in more 
complex computational cost. The unsupervised TV, TVQ, TF and 
DF are the better choices in the cases that efficiency is concerned 
most under the premise of relatively high classification accuracies. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper compares the performances of 20 typical FS methods 
in experiments. Conclusions are given as follows. 
(1) MOR and MC-OR are both the best choices for TC. However, 
the formulas of the two methods are relatively complex. 
(2) IGI is the ideal candidate for MOR and MC-OR. IGI achieves 
good performances which follow the performances of MOR and 
MC-OR. Moreover, the formula of IGI is much simpler. 
(3) TV, TVQ, TF and DF are the better choices in the cases that 
efficiency is concerned most under the premise of relatively high 
classification accuracies. 
(4) In select appropriate FS methods, we need to make a better 
strategy by considering both classification accuracy and 
computational efficiency.
