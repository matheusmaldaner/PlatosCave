Abstract:  This project presents the overall design of Home Automation System (HAS) with low cost and wireless 
system. It specifically focuses on the development of an IOT based home automation system that is able to control various 
components via internet or be automatically programmed to operate from ambient conditions. In this project, we design 
the development of a firmware for smart control which can successfully be automated minimizing human interaction to 
preserve the integrity within whole electrical devices in the home. 
 
A smart home will take advantage of its environment and allow seamless control whether the user is present or away. 
With a home that has this advantage, you can know that your home is performing at its best in energy 
performance. Implementing this system will allow you to explore a variety of engineering tasks, including software 
programming, circuit board design, Wi-Fi, TCP/IP protocols, web server logic design, and other aspects. This automation 
system allows you to better understand the challenges of software and hardware development. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The concept of "home automation" has been around for several years. "Smart Home", "Smart Home" are terms used 
to refer to the concept of network devices in the home. Home automation systems include centralized control 
and remote monitoring of the health of lighting, security systems, and other appliances and systems in your 
home. Home automation systems provide energy efficiency, improve security systems and, of course, increase 
user comfort and convenience. Currently, in emerging markets, HAS is gaining popularity and interest from many users. 
Home automation systems face unique challenges. Basically, current end users, especially the elderly and people with 
disabilities, have benefited enormously, but complexity and cost factors are preventing the system from being embraced. 
 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
People with busy lives these days often forget to turn off their devices at home. As humans, we cannot escape from 
our clumsy and busy lives. Sometimes I make it so rushed that I sometimes forget to turn off the lights. This causes 
electricity prices to skyrocket. Also, this is one of the electricity losses that makes the planet unhealthy. Additionally, the 
elderly and people with disabilities were challenged with manual access to lighting and fan controls instead of automated 
processes. 
PROJECT OBJECTIVES 
 
4.1 To formulate the design of an interconnected network of home appliance to be integrated into the Home Automation 
System . The objective to account for every appliance and its control to be automated and integrated into the network 
further formulated into the Home Automation System . 
 
4.2 To develop the application that would include features of switch and/or voice modes to control the applications. 
4.3 Being able to view the status of home appliances on the application, in order have a better Home Automation System 
4.4 Controlled by any device capable of WiFi (Android, iOS, PC) To achieve flexibility in control of the home appliances, 
and device capable of WiFi connectivity will be able to obtain a secure control on the Home Automation System. 
4.5 
Given 
the existing ability 
to 
add and integrate 
additional 
functions and devices 
into the 
system, 
the developed system should inherently be highly scalable. 
 
SCOPE 
The goal is to develop a prototype that provides wireless remote control of a home appliance network. The app is designed 
to run on Android devices and offers features such as toggle mode control, voice command control and the ability to view 
device status from within the app itself. Considering the wide range of applications, the scope of this prototype is as 
follows: This system can be implemented in homes, small offices, and shopping centers responsible for managing 
consumer electronics. For remote access to devices on the Internet or intranet. Devices in the above environment can be 
managed on an intranet or accessed via the Internet. Development of a technology-friendly environment. These systems 
include the use of technology and the creation of home automation systems. By using our everyday gadgets, we can use 
them from a different perspective.

LITERATURE SURVEY 
 
“Smart Energy Efficient Home Automation System using IOT”, by Satyendra K. Vishwakarma, Prashant 
Upadhyaya, Babita Kumari, Arun Kumar Mishra.  
This paper presents a step-by-step procedure of a smart home automation controller. It uses IOT to convert home 
appliances to smart and intelligent devices, with the help of design control. An energy efficient system is designed that 
accesses the smart home remotely using IOT connectivity. The proposed system mainly requires, Node MCU as the 
microcontroller unit, IFTTT to interpret voice commands, Adafruit a library that supports MQTT acts as an MQTT broker 
and Arduino IDE to code the microcontroller. This multimodal system uses Google Assistant along with a web based 
application to control the smart home. The smart home is implemented with main controller unit that is connected with 
the 24-hour available Wi-Fi network. To ensure, that the Wi-Fi connection do not turn off, the main controller is 
programmed to establish automatic connection with the available network and connected to the auto power backup.  
 
“IOT Based Smart Security and Home Automation”, by Shardha Somani, Parikshit Solunke, Shaunak Oke, Parth 
Medhi, Prof. P. P. Laturkar.  
This paper focuses on a system that provides features of Home Automation relying on IOT to operate easily, in addition 
to that it includes a camera module and provides home security. The android application basically converts Smartphone 
into a remote for all home appliances. Security is achieved with motion sensors if movement is sensed at the entrance of 
the house; a notification is sent that contains a photo of house entrance in real time. This notification will be received by 
the owner of the house via internet such that app can trigger a notification. So owner can raise an alarm in case of any 
intrusion or he/she can toggle the appliances like opening the door if the person is a guest. The system uses Raspberry Pi, 
a small sized computer which acts as server for the system. The smart home consist two modules. Home automation that 
consists; fan light and door controller, and security module that consists; smoke sensor motion sensor and camera module.  
 
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
 
Software Components :- 
• 
Arduino IDE 
•

you the 
flexibility to 
use open source 
code. 
Easy 
access 
to 
built-in 
sensors. 
Applications used for system administration have the following features: Android Phone acts as a client and data is sent 
via socket programming. The application accepts user commands in two different modes.  
Switch Mode: Switch Mode uses switches used to control household appliances. A radio button sends the state of 
the radio button.  
Voice Mode: Voice mode is used to control household appliances using voice commands. The app uses the smartphone's 
built-in microphone to 
generate an 
intent to 
get 
voice data 
to Google's 
servers, which respond 
as string 
data. String data is further parsed and then processed. 
 
The developed prototype features: 
A wireless remote switching system for home appliances is installed on the prototype. 
 
Prototype set up radio control using Wi-Fi, providing an indoor range of approximately 150 feet.  
You can use the switch in the application on your smartphone to give a command to turn the device on and off. 
 
Provisions have also been made to remotely switch household appliances using voice commands from a smartphone. 
You can control the prototype using any device that has a WiFi connection. 
 
Control of household appliances is carried out over a secure connection over SSL over TCP, SSH.
