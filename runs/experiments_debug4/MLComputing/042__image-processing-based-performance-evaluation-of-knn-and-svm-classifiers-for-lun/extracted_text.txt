Abstract—It is important to note that the cure rates in cases 
of advanced stages of lung cancer are remarkably low, which 
stresses out the importance for early detection as means to 
increase survival chances. A strong area of focus when it comes 
to increased research in the lung cancer diagnosis is the search 
for ways through which this disease can be identified at its early 
stages. The methodology described below is proposed as a means 
to facilitate early detection of lung cancer. There are two phases 
in this approach. The study deals with effectiveness of three types 
of classifiers K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest and 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify cases related to lung 
cancer via relevant medical data assessment. In this application, 
the eval axis performs profiling or measures the accuracy of 
applying these classifiers and discriminating between cancerous 
instances versus non-cancerous ones within the dataset. To rate 
the adequacy of classifiers in distinguishing classes, performance 
metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1- score are 
used. Furthermore, the research compares KNN, Random Forest 
and SVM, explaining their specific advantages as well as 
disadvantages logically referring to how they can or cannot be 
applied while detecting lung cancer. This investigation shows 
helpful results in suggesting the possibility that machine learning 
techniques could assist to identify lung cancer as exact and timely 
as possible, providing more successful diagnostic procedures and 
patient outcomes. The experimental findings show that SVM 
gives the best result at 95.06%, KNN comes second with a 
percentage of 86.89.

INTRODUCTION 
A seamless connectivity to users is provided by wireless 
cancer stands as a formidable threat to human life, frequently 
leading to fatalities globally due to delayed diagnoses. The 
primary role of the lungs involves supplying the body with 
oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide during essential bodily 
functions. Lung cancer develops from uncontrolled tissue and 
cell growth within the lungs, which, left unchecked, can 
spread and harm neighboring tissues. It claims around 1.3 
million lives yearly globally, with 30–40,000 new cases in 
Turkey every year, and is the top cause of cancer-related 
deaths among men and the second-leading cause among 
females [1]. 
The impact of this disease is profound, evidenced by its 
higher mortality rate compared to combined rates of 
correctional, pancreatic, and breast cancers. For example, in 
2020, an estimated 30,000 Canadians were expected to be 
diagnosed, resulting in approximately 21,000 deaths. Globally, 
the burden of cancer is predicted to double by 2050, with lung 
cancer at the forefront [2]. Late-stage diagnoses often lead to 
the fatality of lung cancer. 
 A comprehensive understanding of its development, along 
with effective early detection methods and suitable treatments, 
significantly influences better outcomes. Lung cancer often 
becomes lethal because of late-stage diagnosis. Improved 
outcomes are largely dependent on a thorough understanding 
of the pathophysiology, appropriate medications, and efficient 
early detection techniques. 
As a result, it is still crucial to detect lung cancer as soon 
as possible, particularly in high-risk groups like smokers or 
people who work in toxic settings or are exposed to oil fields 
[3, 4]. Novel biomarkers are desperately needed to help with 
this population screening.  Lung cancer symptoms could not 
cause serious problems until the illness is fairly advanced [5, 
6]. 
The primary cause of lung cancer's extreme hazard is its 
ability to progress without showing any signs. About 25% of 
cancer patients experience no symptoms at all.  Most people 
find out that lung X-rays from another illness cause lung 
cancer. When it comes to lung cancer, early diagnosis is 
crucial [7, 8]. Due to the fact that lung cancer frequently 
spreads quickly to the brain, liver, adrenal glands, and bones. 
However, the average life expectancy and quality have 
grown with the recently developed lung cancer treatment 
approaches. Thanks to developments in imaging methods like 
low-dose spiral computed tomography, lung cancer can now 
be identified early on.

LITERATURE SURVEY 
One of the deadliest illnesses a person can have is cancer. 
The late diagnosis can result in deaths worldwide. The lungs 
are responsible for fundamental biological activities such as 
breathing in oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide. Lung cancer 
develops when lung tissues and cells multiply uncontrollably.

As they grow unchecked in their natural habitat, these tumours 
pose a threat to adjacent tissues via metastasis. While lung 
cancer ranks second for women, it tops the list for males when 
it comes to cancer-related deaths [9,10].  An estimated 1.3 
million individuals worldwide pass away from lung cancer 
each year. Every year in Turkey, between 30,000 and 40,000 
new cases of lung cancer are reported. Lung cancer symptoms 
could not cause serious problems until the illness is fairly 
advanced. The primary feature that makes lung cancer so 
hazardous is its ability to progress without symptoms [11, 12]. 
About 25% of cancer patients experience no symptoms at all. 
Most people find out that lung X-rays from another illness 
cause lung cancer. Lung cancer identification at an early stage 
is crucial. Due to the fact that lung cancer frequently spreads 
quickly to the brain, liver, adrenal glands, and bones. On the 
other hand, the average life expectancy and quality have 
grown with the recently developed lung cancer treatment 
approaches [13,14]. Thanks to developments in imaging 
methods like low-dose spiral computed tomography, lung 
cancer can now be identified early on. Moreover, accurate 
diagnosis is essential for developing the best possible 
treatment plans for each lung cancer patient [15, 16]. 
Therefore, in order to improve prognosis and treatment results, 
the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early 
detection has arisen as a crucial necessity in the field [17, 18].  
Building machine learning models to improve lung cancer 
detection and prediction accuracy is the main goal of this 
work. This study aims to find the best model for early-stage 
lung cancer detection by using several classifiers and 
comparing their performance measures [19, 20]. Regarding 
lung cancer, this effort has significant potential for enhancing 
patients’ outcomes with early detection. The proposed strategy 
in this study is quite strong as well, enabling for an 
impressively high accuracy ratio of predicting lung cancer 
early on. In this work, the dataset used is gathered from 
reputable research centers and that of the Machine Learning 
Repository. To determine and compare the ratios of their 
accuracy, we have utilized two different classifiers out here 
SVM and KNN. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The lung cancer detection and prediction have been 
developed in MATLAB using an effective algorithm based on 
the image processing techniques. One of the detection 
methods utilised by this algorithm is that of a multi-stage 
classification process in diagnosing lung cancer, and so 
forth. First, it verifies if there can be ones or more cells in the 
input image impacted by cancer; otherwise it proceeds with 
determining if lung cancer is going to occur. The cancer 
algorithm has an additional stage after identifying that it is a 
case of cancer. This involves further malignancies being 
classified or divided into early, intermediate and advanced 
staging of the disease. There is a series of classification steps 
before each of them to develop a variety of segmentation and 
picture enhancement techniques. Techniques like contrast 
enhancement, colour space modification, and image scaling 
are all part of image enhancement. For segmentation purposes, 
the algorithm utilizes thresholding and marker-controlled 
watershed-based techniques. The comprehensive workflow of 
this proposed system is illustrated in Fig. 1, outlining the 
sequential stages and processes involved in the detection and 
prediction of lung cancer through image processing methods. 
IV. 
DATA COLLECTION 
Gather a diverse dataset containing relevant patient 
information, including clinical attributes and diagnostic 
indicators related to lung cancer. The effectiveness of machine 
learning models relies heavily on datasets sourced from 
credible origins, particularly those encompassing a substantial 
volume of images. Numerous datasets are accessible, 
facilitating lung disease detection, and some researchers opt to 
create their datasets for enhanced accuracy [21, 22]. Even so, 
there are several other publicly accessible datasets for research 
and teaching on the internet. Examples of lung CT scan 
pictures used in this study's experimental analysis are shown 
graphically in Fig. 2. These images serve as representative 
samples from the dataset used, demonstrating the type and 
quality of data utilized for the research's experimental 
investigations [23]. The model has been trained and tested 
using the LIDC-IDRI lung CT scan dataset for the proposed 
task. In our efforts to verify and confirm the findings of our 
study, we obtained a specific set of samples from 
Adichunchanagiri Hospital and Research Centre (AHRC) as 
well as Adichunchanagiri Institute of Medical Sciences 
(AIMS), located in BG Nagara, Mandya. 
V. 
DATA PREPROCESSING 
Address outliers, inconsistencies, missing numbers, and 
clean up the dataset. Make sure that the feature scales are 
consistent by normalising or standardising the data. An 
essential part of the standard work flow when developing a 
machine learning model entails image pre-processing. Since 
datasets 
commonly 
include 
image 
files 
of 
different 
dimensions, Formats and the possibility of having noise or 
blurriness, pre-processing these images prior to machine 
learning training is necessary.  CLAHE Contrast Limited 
Adaptive Histogram Equalisation, Wiener filtering, Adaptive 
Gaussian Filtering and Gaussian and Gabor filtering are some 
of the most commonly used pre-processing methods for 
analysis (see Fig. 3). Through application of these techniques 
to the data, one can normalize the images, correct for size and 
format variations and minimize noise or smudging thus 
benefiting optimally from the data for more productive use in 
machine learning models [24, 25]. 
VI. 
MODEL TRAINING 
A. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier 
      The KNN algorithm classifies datasets based on the 
similarity of one sample with another in terms of a set of 
neighbors. The number of neighboring datasets considered is 
K. It uses the process of Euclidean Distance (ED) 
measurement to classify by comparing similarity between test 
sample and other samples in the database. The provided 
sentence describes the given distance in terms of the 
Euclidean plane between two sets of coordinates, X and Y.

The diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) images is 
based on the Entropy Degradation Method (EDM), as 
proposed by Qing Wu et al. in their study [13]. This includes a 
set of inputs called EDM associated with every training set 
which upon being transformed into an EDM score, applied 
through the logistic function gives it a probability [26]. The 
testing phase, an input is used which contains no markings and 
injected into a neural system. The output is subsequently 
computed by making use of the scores probabilities. So this 
final output is very crucial because it helps in determining the 
category to which the testing data belongs i. It can tell that 
whether patient is suffering with cancer or not and in non-
cancerous person, will be found with either normal function.

The total size of input x is N which, for values of n being 
either 0 or 1, where p=n serves as an indicator function and M 
ranges from 1 to the size of the input x; the estimated signals 
of maximum entropy are Y = cd f (y). The calculation of its 
value involves the function h, expressed as follows: 
ℎ= log (det(𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝑊)) +

Where, W denotes an identity 5x5 matrix. 
W = w + eta × (g) 
where, eta defines the rate of convergence and the gradient 
matrix is given by g. 
B. SVM Classifier 
SVM is one of the popular approaches used in supervised 
learning, which is frequently adopted to address problems 
touching on both regression and classification (see Fig. 
4). This is a form of machine learning mostly used in 
classification tasks, SVM. It ensures that the margin of 
separation between classes is maximised by building a 
hyperplane. For instance, SVM applies its method to generate 
a hyperplane that separates different categories of NSCLC in 
the field classification of lung cancer varieties. This aim is to 
determine the lung cancer type using NSCLC categories 
accurately. For an n-dimensional space, SVM algorithm aims 
at producing that magical line or decision border in space 
which is best in organizing the classes. This decision boundary 
is also sometimes called a hyperplane and determines how 
future additional data points will be classified on the 
accuracy. Support Vector Machine is the name of some 
particular method because these situations we are discussing 
are called support vectors. The Sample cases of Normal, 
Benign and Malignant CT images as shown in Fig. 5. This 
way the algorithm’s ability to correctly classify data is 
enhanced in the process of determining the optimum decision 
boundary with aid of these support vectors. 
C. Random Forest 
Machine learning's Random Forest method pools the 
power of several decision trees to provide accurate forecasts 
(see Fig. 6). This method comes up with a huge number of 
decision trees while training, each employing different subset 
of the features and data. Random Forest achieves a diversified 
prediction by outputting multiple diverse trees produced 
through the process of bootstrap sampling and feature 
randomness. During categorization, it sums up the outcomes 
from individual trees through a majority voting scheme; for 
regression tasks, it averages the results of constituent 
trees. Importantly, Random Forest is known as a method that 
can work with high-dimensional data and helps to minimize 
overfitting as well as reveals the importance of features. It, 
therefore, has a very wide-ranging application in many fields 
where precise predictions are important.

RESULTS 
The CT images used in this study were obtained from 
Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) of the NIH-
NCI. For the purpose of lung cancer diagnosis and screening, 
the Lung Image Database Consortium Image Collection 
(LIDC-IDRI) contains 
microscopic slides of thoracic 
computed tomography images labelled with lesions. 1) 
CancerTool is a freely available online application designed 
specifically for the identification and diagnosis of lung cancer 
using computer-aided diagnostic 
methods. This dataset 
provides a comprehensive and annotated collection for 
researchers in the field, enabling them to improve on 
computational methods. For the purpose of our computational 
processes we have utilized LIDC-IDRI database especially in 
reference to the training dataset. At the feature extraction 
stage, analogy of origin CT images that were initially 512x512 
x3 are downsized to 256x. From this dataset, we took a sample 
of 500 images to do our experiment. In this investigation, two 
mutually exclusive labels were taken into consideration: (i) 
abnormal with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in 
various stages; (ii) normal, i.e., images displaying no 
radiological abnormalities. Thirty percent of the available data 
was set aside for accuracy evaluation and result verification, 
and the remaining seventy percent was used to train the 
model. A tabular format was created by computing and 
organizing metrics such as Accuracy, False Positive Rate, and 
True Positive Rate (TPR). A small number of samples are 
taken from the AHRC and AIMS, BG Nagara, Mandya, in 
order to confirm our findings. In order to validate the data we 
received, the proposed task was carried out under the 
supervision of AIMS, a radiologist. The inventors claim that 
the 
recommended 
diagnostic 
system 
gives 
renowned 
physicians a precise and quick diagnosis.

accuracy achieved by the system for predicting a specific type 
of lung cancer stood at 95.06%. In addition to accuracy, this 
study scrutinized other pivotal metrics essential for gauging 
overall performance. These metrics encompass precision, 
recall, AUC (Area Under the Curve), and F1 score. Each 
metric was calculated and tabulated for individual classes 
using the identical 5-fold cross-validation approach, and the 
findings were consolidated for comprehensive analysis and 
comparison. 
Similarly, Table II presents the performance evaluation 
outcomes of lung cancer prediction utilizing the KNN 
classifier. This classifier is also able to classify the subtypes of 
the lung cancer with an accuracy of 86.89%. Table III.

The NSCLS with different stages is presented in Fig. 7. In 
the lung cancer classification, SVM typically overcomes KNN 
and Random Forest because it can effectively handle complex 
relationships of data and high-dimensional features as shown 
in Fig. 8. SVM’s ability to detect intricate patterns in datasets, 
especially those with nuanced characteristics, such as lung 
cancer data often results in more precision and reliability in 
classifying the results compared to KNN and Random Forest 
algorithms across the specific medical field attributed 
confusion matrix of stark face.

DISCUSSIONS 
The four main kinds of lung cancer adenocarcinoma, large 
cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and normal are all 
correctly identified by the suggested approach. Fig. 9 
illustrates the Confusion Matrix associated with the 
classification for lung cancer. The Confusion Matrix depicted 
therein highlights correctly categorized samples via green 
diagonal 
points, 
while 
non-diagonal 
points 
signify 
misclassified samples. This visualization aids in understanding 
the model's performance in accurately classifying different 
types of lung cancers, emphasizing correct classifications 
(green points) and areas needing improvement (non-diagonal 
points). 
Notably, the ROC-AUC values exceed 0.99 for every 
class, underscoring the remarkable proficiency of the model in 
accurately distinguishing between these diverse classes. In 
comparative performance among KNN, Random Forest, and 
SVM, while both KNN and Random Forest exhibit strengths 
in certain scenarios due to their simplicity and ensemble 
nature respectively, SVM stands out for its robustness in 
handling complex decision boundaries and high-dimensional 
data as in Fig. 10. SVM often excels when the dataset is 
characterized by intricate relationships between features, as it 
effectively finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes, 
leading to superior generalization and accuracy in such 
situations. A comparison between our generated model and 
the most advanced model in the field is shown in Table IV and 
Fig. 11. Our model outperforms other models in terms of 
accuracy, according to the findings. This comparison shows 
that our model is somewhat more accurate than the current 
state-of-the-art models in the field.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The study utilizes 500 lung images for predictive analysis 
within the proposed algorithm. The training dataset for lung 
cancer is obtained from a recognized machine learning 
database. CT images sourced from the NIH-NCI - LIDC form 
the basis of this research. Its objective is to assess and contrast 
the performance of three classifiers in early-stage lung cancer 
diagnosis. Results reveal that the SVM demonstrated the 
highest accuracy, reaching 95.05%. This finding highlights 
SVM's potential in detecting lung cancer in its early stages, 
potentially contributing to saving numerous lives. Conversely, 
the random forest and KNN algorithm exhibited lower 
accuracy, recording 81.96% and 88.40% respectively.  Finally, 
the proposed work underwent validation using samples 
collected from AHRC and AIMS, BG Nagara, Mandya. Under 
the supervision of a radiologist at AIMS, these datasets were 
employed to authenticate our obtained results. As per the 
developers, this diagnostic system offers top doctors an 
accurate and swift diagnosis, and we utilized these datasets for 
validation purposes. Based on the satisfactory outcomes of 
this research, future work will focus on improving the 
performance and reliability of the proposed model utilizing a 
more comprehensive and diverse data collection with images 
of people from different backgrounds and different stages of 
lung cancer.
