Abstract  
Digitalization in medicine has become one of the largest gaps in almost all healthcare systems 
in the world. Diabetes remains one of the pressing health problems. According to World Health 
Organization, the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 
million in 2014. This research is devoted to solving the problem of classifying patients with 
diabetes and diagnosing this disease. To solve the problem, a machine learning model was built 
based on a decision tree method. To develop the model, an open database of patients with 
diabetes, consisting of 768 patients, was used. On the foundation of the constructed model, a 
software package in the Python language has been developed.

1. Introduction 
The world pandemic of the new coronavirus has changed the usual way of life and approaches to 
solve medical tasks [1].  
Right now, digitalization in medicine has become one of the largest gaps in almost all healthcare 
systems in the world. As practice shows, digital technologies can significantly improve the quality of 
healthcare [2]. For example, modern models of the spread of infectious diseases [3], such as HIV [4], 
tuberculous [5], hepatitis B [6], influenza and ARVI [7], syphilis [8], and others, make it possible to 
predict the incidence and develop effective preventive measures to reduce the incidence. The 
development of management systems [9-11] for medical institutions and medical insurance systems 
[12] allows automating decision making. Information technologies help medical staff during surgeries 
[13-15]. Automated training systems for medical personnel allow timely updating of their knowledge 
[16-18]. Modern techniques of medical images analysis [19-20] and methods for diagnosing common 
diseases such as cancer [21-22] or heart disease [23] can detect diseases at an early stage. 
Diabetes remains one of the pressing health problems. According to World Health Organization, the 
number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 [24]. The 
global prevalence of diabetes among people over 18 years of age increased from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% 
in 2014 [25]. Premature mortality from diabetes increased by 5% between 2000 and 2016 [26]. Some 
scientists have linked cases of childhood diabetes with COVID-19 [27]. 
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease of the endocrine system, which is caused by a violation of 
insulin synthesis and an increase in blood sugar. The disease can lead to the development of a number 
of serious deficiencies. There are 2 main types of diabetes mellitus: types I and II, as well as gestational 
diabetes in pregnant women and symptomatic diabetes. Let's consider 2 main types, from which more 
and more people are suffering from all over the globe every day. Diabetes mellitus type I is more

common in patients under the age of 30, more often it develops due to the fact that the pancreas begins 
to work worse against the background of a viral infection or the action of toxins. With this type of 
diabetes, the body is unable to produce insulin, thus, when diagnosed with type I diabetes, the patient 
becomes insulin dependent throughout his life. Diabetes mellitus type II - occurs due to insulin 
resistance, of which they get sick more often. Older people are more prone to it, because sugar tolerance 
decreases over the years. There are a number of factors that increase your risk of developing type II 
diabetes. [28]. 
The symptoms depend on how long the person is sick, on the severity of the disease and the patient's 
personal immunity. Someone may have a vivid clinical picture right away, while someone may have a 
barely noticeable clinic or, even worse, be absent. Diabetes can be diagnosed using a variety of 
diagnostics. The main method for diagnosing diabetes mellitus is laboratory tests of urine and blood for 
glucose levels. In some cases, the doctor may prescribe an ultrasound of the kidneys, an EEG of the 
brain, etc. People at risk should carefully monitor their blood glucose and blood pressure levels. 
An important challenge in the fight against diabetes is the classification of patients and the diagnosis 
of the disease. To solve this problem, it is advisable to use a machine learning apparatus. In modern 
science, several models have been implemented that make it possible to diagnose diabetes according to 
specified parameters. 
Sisodia S. and Sisodia D.S. have made prediction model of Diabetes using naïve Bayes algorithm 
with accuracy 76.3% [29]. Naveen K. has made classification model of Diabetes using SVM algorithm 
and data of glucose and blood pressure [30].  
These and other analyzed researches show the limitations of the factors used to train the model, 
which leads to a decrease in the classification accuracy. 
The aim of the research is to build a model that allows classifying a person's condition in relation 
to the incidence of diabetes using machine learning methods. 
2. Materials and Methods 
To solve the problem, we use the decision trees method [31-32]. The decision tree is a sequential 
hierarchical structure and includes: branches with attributes on which the result depends - the objective 
function; nodes - random vertices in which possible scenarios for the development of events are 
determined; leaf (leaf) nodes with objective function values represent the final results of choosing a 
specific attribute value and combine several objects. Decision trees are divided into two types by the 
type of predicted indicator: classification trees and regression trees. When developing a system for 
establishing a diagnosis, it is advisable to use classification trees, since they are used research on certain 
attributes, namely, to attribute objects (symptoms) from a previously known class (a certain disease). 
Decision trees divide data into groups, resulting in a hierarchy of "if ... then ..." operators that classifies 
data. 
Let's define an objective function in order to divide the nodes into informative functions. Each 
partition where we maximize the increment is: 
 
 
𝛪𝐺(𝐷𝑝, 𝑓) = 𝐼(𝐷𝑝) − ∑
𝑁𝑗
𝑁𝑝
𝑚
𝑗=1
𝐼(𝐷𝑗) 
 
 
(1) 
 
where f is attribute by which splitting is performed; Dp and Dj are parent and j-th child nodes; Ι is a 
measure of heterogeneity; Np is the total number of samples in the parent node; Nj is the number of 
samples in the j-th child node. 
For simplicity and to reduce the combinatorial search space, we implement binary decision trees. In 
our case, child nodes Dleft and Dright are: 
 
 
𝛪𝐺(𝐷𝑝, 𝑓) = 𝐼(𝐷𝑝) − 
𝑁𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡
𝑁𝑝𝐼(𝐷𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡) − 
𝑁𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡
𝑁𝑝
𝐼(𝐷𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡) 
 
(2) 
 
where f is attribute by which splitting is performed; Dp and Dj are datasets of parent and j-th child nodes; 
Ι is a measure of heterogeneity; Np is total number of samples in parent node; Dleft and Dright are child 


--- Page 3 ---
nodes; Nleft and Nright are numbers of patterns in left and right child nodes; Nj is number of samples in  
j-th child node. 
Determination of entropy for all non-empty classes 𝑝(𝑖|𝑡) ≠02: 
 
 
𝐼𝐻(𝑡) = −∑
𝑝(𝑖|𝑡)𝑙𝑜𝑔2𝑝(𝑖|𝑡)
𝑐
𝑖=1
  
 
 
(3) 
 
where 𝑝(𝑖|𝑡) is fraction of samples that belongs to class and single node t. 
So, the entropy is 0 if all samples in a node belong to the same class, and the entropy is maximal if 
we have a uniform distribution of classes. 
The Gini measure of heterogeneity [33] can be perceived as a criterion that minimizes the likelihood 
of misclassification: 
 
 
𝐼𝐺(𝑡) = ∑
𝑝(𝑖|𝑡)(1 −𝑝(𝑖|𝑡)) = 1 − 
𝑐
𝑖=1
 ∑
𝑝(𝑖|𝑡)2
𝑐
𝑖=1
 
 
(4) 
 
where 𝑝(𝑖|𝑡) is fraction of samples that belongs to a class and a single node t; LG(t) is Gini measure of 
heterogeneity. 
Another measure of heterogeneity is classification error: 
 
 
𝐼𝜀(𝑡) = 1 −max {𝑝(𝑖|𝑡)}  
 
 
 
(5) 
 
where 𝑝(𝑖|𝑡) is fraction of samples that belongs to a class and a single node t; 𝐼𝜀(𝑡) is classification error. 
This criterion is suitable for tree pruning, but is not recommended for tree growth because it is less 
sensitive to changes in the capabilities of the classes in the nodes. 
3. Implementation and results 
In order to build a decision tree, you need certain data. The Pima Indians Diabetes DataBase was 
used to test the diabetes diagnostic model. Database has 768 instances and 9 attributes for individual 
patients (Table 1). 
 
Table 1 
Full list of parameters 
 
The data distribution is shown in Figure 1. 
Since data is the most important factor for effective work of the classifier, it is important to know 
which features from the dataset have the greatest impact on the classification, and which ones, on the 
contrary, have no effect at all. With this information, you can manipulate what data to input. Thus, you 
can increase the value of the system, because at this stage, after receiving the results, a doctor's 
consultation and more accurate diagnosis are still needed. There are certain signs in this dataset that the 
user will not be able to find out for himself, however, there is a possibility that the value of the system 
will fall to him if he first learns these signs from a doctor.

Figure 1: Data distribution 
 
As we can see from the plot, there are some outliers in some of the columns.  
We can see that there are 0 values for blood pressure. So, we assume that it is mistake data. 
Observing the data, we see 35 samples, where the value is 0. Even after fasting, your glucose level will 
not go below zero. Therefore, zero is a misread. Before further use of the selection, remove the lines 
with “BloodPressure”, “BMI” and “Glucose” equal to zero. 
The Spyder development environment was used to write the code to build the decision tree. In order 
to read our data from the table, the Pandas library was used. The Scikit-learn machine learning library 
was also used. To implement a decision tree, you need to import the required Python packages. Then 
we upload our database. 
The next step is to split this data into two parts - training data and testing data. Next, you need to 
train the model using the DecisionTreeClassifier class (Scikit-learn library). Next, we make a forecast, 
and we also need to get an accuracy estimate, a classification report and an error matrix. The final step 
is to render our decision tree [34]. The color of the nodes is used to highlight the class that has the most 
in each node and to convey the names of the classes and traits so that the tree is correctly marked up. 
For the first experiment, the data was split as follows: 70% for training and 30% for testing. The 
results are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

4. Conclusions 
Overall, it can be said that decision tree analysis is a predictive modeling tool that can be applied in 
many areas. Decision trees can be built using an algorithmic approach that can partition the dataset in 
different ways depending on conditions. 
After the work done, we can conclude that the more data is allocated for training the model, the 
better the accuracy estimate we get. In our case, the best option is to split the data by 50% for training 
the model and 50% for testing, since the accuracy of this option is 0.71. 
After analyzing the constructed diagnostic model, the following advantages can be identified: fast 
learning process; generation of rules in areas where it is difficult for an expert to formalize his 
knowledge; intuitive classification model; high prediction accuracy, comparable to other methods of 
data analysis (statistics, neural networks); construction of nonparametric models.
