Abstract— Heart disease is a common, 
universal and a life threatening condition which 
requires early treatment and prior prediction. In 
this research study, we have proposed the 
utilization of K-nearest neighbors algorithm for 
prediction of the heart disease. The KNN 
algorithm relies on the non-parametric and 
instance based classification which has shown 
the most promising results in various domains. 
The main aim of this research is to develop a 
model which accurately predicts the possibility 
of the heart disease using KNN algorithm by 
leveraging a comprehensive dataset of clinical 
and demographic features. The dataset usually 
comprises the records of many patients, their 
risk factors, medical history and the diagnosed 
test results. In order to determine the challenges 
associated with the prediction of heart disease, 
we follow 'feature selection' techniques to detect 
the most accurate disease. Alongwith this, we 
handle the issue of the imbalanced data by 
implementing appropriate weighting strategies. 
The K-nearest neighbors algorithm is carried 
out by implementing various parameters like 
K(number of neighbors) and distances to 
optimize the performance of KNN model. 
Cross-validation

1.INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Application Introduction: 
Heart Disease is one among the leading causes for 
the deaths worldwide and its early detection plays 
a major role in the prevention . Our application

such as gender, age, cholesterol levels, diabetes 
alongwith other medical history. Our algorithm 
will then enumerate this data and generate a 
personalized risk assessment report. 
This application will provide us with an easy to 
understand prediction of patient's chances of 
being diagnosed with a heart disease within a 
specified time period. It also highlights the major 
factors aiding the risk, allowing the patient to take 
preventive steps for improving the health. 
Algorithm Introduction: 
The K-nearest neighbors(KNN) algorithm is a 
machine learning method used for predictions, 
including heart disease prediction . It is a 
supervised learning algorithm which works on the 
principle of similarity. 
In context to the heart disease prediction, the KNN 
algorithm uses a labelled dataset that involves 
information of various attributes such as age, 
gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and other 
factors. Each individual in the given dataset is 
labelled as either they are suffering with the heart 
disease or not suffering with any heart disease. 
When an individual's data is provided, the KNN 
algorithm calculates the similarity between the 
individual and the labelled data points in the 
dataset. It does it by measuring the distance 
between the individual's attribute values of the 
labelled data points. 
The KNN algorithm then selects the K-nearest 
neighbors(data points with the closest attribute 
values) and determines the majority class among 
these neighbors. This majority class is used to 
predict if the individual is expected to be diagnosed 
with the heart disease or not. 
Its very important to note the choice of K(number 
of neighbors) which can have an effect on the 
algorithm's performance. Additionally, feature 
selection and data preprocessing are the crucial 
steps in preparing the dataset for accurate 
predictions. Overall, the KNN algorithm can be 
considered as one of the useful tools for detecting 
the heart diseases depending on the similarities 
between the individuals and their attributes. 
However, its always recommended to consult the 
medical professionals for accurate diagnosis and 
treatment. 
Objectives: 
The objectives of using the KNN (K-Nearest 
Neighbors) 
algorithm 
in 
heart 
disease 
prognostication are as follows: 
1. Classification: The chief objective of the KNN 
algorithm is to classify patients into various 
categories, such as if cardiac disease is present or 
not. 
By 
analyzing 
the 
features 
and 
the 
characteristics of patients, the algorithm aims to 
accurately assign them to the appropriate class. 
2. Prediction: Depending on the input features, 
KNN is also used to estimate the probability or 
chance that a person has cardiac disease. This can 
provide significant insights into risk assessment, 
and it helps in making informed decisions 
concerning further medical interventions or 
treatments. 
3. Accuracy: This KNN algorithm aims to obtain 
high accuracy in predicting heart disease. By 
considering the K-nearest neighbors of a given 
patient, the algorithm leverages the similarities and 
models of the data in making promising predictions. 
The aim is to reduce false positives and false 
negatives, ensuring reliable predictions. 
4. Early detection: Another objective of using KNN 
in prognosticating the heart disease is to aid in early 
detection. By analyzing the input features and 
assessing them with the historical data, the 
algorithm can identify potential signs, or the risky 
factors related with the heart disease. This enables 
quick interventions and preventive steps to reduce 
the severity of the condition. 
Overall, the KNN algorithm aims to provide 
accurate, reliable, and timely predictions for heart 
disease, assisting in risk assessment, early 
detection, and decision-making in healthcare 
settings. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
In today's fast-paced nature, people often 
prioritize work and earning a living over taking 
care of their health. This leads to change in their 
diet and lifestyle, causing high stress and tension. 
Unfortunately, this can also increase the risk of 
developing conditions like high blood pressure, 
diabetes, and other diseases at a younger age. 
These factors contribute to a negligence of their

health, which can eventually lead to heart disease. 
The heart is a vital organ that affects the 
functioning of other important organs in the body. 
Traditional methods of diagnosing heart disease 
rely on a patient's medical history, but these 
approaches may not always yield accurate results. 
This can lead to biases, errors, and high medical 
costs, eventually impacting the quality of patient 
care. Additionally, medical decisions are often 
based on a physician's experience rather than on 
comprehensive data analysis, further highlighting 
the need for more accurate and data-driven 
approaches in diagnosing and treating heart 
conditions. 
However, over recent years, the healthcare sector 
has witnessed significant progress in data mining 
and machine learning. These methods have been 
broadly embraced and proven effective in 
numerous healthcare applications, Especially in 
medical cardiology. Despite these advancements, 
heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality 
in developing nations. Consequently, there is a 
continued emphasis on identifying risk factors 
and early indicators of the disease, highlighting 
the importance of ongoing research in this area. 
One such algorithm that researchers have used for 
predicting heart disease risk is the K-nearest 
neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This algorithm 
collects features such as age, cholesterol levels, 
blood pressure, and other relevant information 
from patients. Based on these features, the 
algorithm is trained to predict whether a patient is 
at risk of heart disease. The dataset used for 
training contains labelled examples of patients 
with and without heart disease. 
In this project, we have incorporated the KNN 
Classifier, an AI algorithm that aims to predict 
heart disease by collecting relevant information 
from doctors, including data on resting blood 
pressure, cholesterol levels, thalassemia, and 
diabetes status, among other factors. This 
algorithm can help healthcare professionals make 
accurate, reliable, and timely assessments that 
empower them to intervene effectively, detect 
issues early, and make informed decisions for the 
well-being of their patients. 
Related Work: 
J Thomas, R Theresa Princy [1], utilized a union 
of the Neural networks, decision trees, naïve 
Bayes, and the K-nearest neighbor method are 
used to predict cardiac problems. They applied 
knowledge of mining methods to assess the risk 
rate of the heart conditions. 
Himanshu Sharma and M A Rizvi [2] employed 
Decision trees, SVM, Deep Learning, and K- 
Nearest Neighbours algorithms in their study. To 
acknowledge the noise in the datasets, they 
focused on cleaning and pre-processing the data, 
and also reducing its dimensionality. Their 
finding highlighted that neural network could 
attain high precision in such scenarios. 
 
Amandeep Kaur et al. [14] guided a comparative 
comparison of several algorithms, including K- 
nearest neighbours, artificial neural networks, 
SVM, and Naïve Bayes, for identifying heart 
conditions. 
In an analysis conducted by Alotalibi (2019) [19], 
the 
emphasis 
was 
on 
investigating 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
machine 
learning 
(ML) 
techniques in detecting heart failure illness. The 
dataset used in the study came from the Cleveland 
Clinic Foundation and applied various ML 
methods, such as logistic regression, random 
forests, decision trees, logistic regression, and 
support vector machines (SVM) to construct 
prediction models. The development process of 
these models incorporated a 10-fold cross- 
validation approach. The results showed that the 
SVM method had the second-highest prediction 
precision (92.30%) for heart disease, behind the 
decision tree technique (93.19%). 
 
In an alternative study conducted by L. H. Malik,

Classifiers. The outcomes which were obtained 
could find whether the person could be suffering 
with any of the heart diseases in the coming time 
through the medical record of the person. 
Another research was performed by Nouh Sabri 
Elmitwally [20], the methodology used was 
Support Vector Machine(SVM).The results were 
that this method was with the accuracy of 90.47% 
and could identify the heart disease as early as 
possible and the person can be given the proper 
treatment on time. 
III. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
Problems with regression and classification are 
addressed by the supervised machine learning 
technique known as the K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN) algorithm. Joseph Hodges and Evelyn Fix 
proposed this algorithm in 1951, which was 
subsequently developed by Thomas Cover. 
The KNN method is a popular and adaptable 
machine learning technique that is mostly used 
due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. 
No presumptions on the underlying data 
distribution are necessary. It is an adaptable 
option for a variety of dataset types in regression 
and classification applications because it can 
handle both numerical and categorical data. This 
approach, which is non-parametric, bases its 
predictions on how similar the data points are to 
one another across datasets. The sensitivity of K- 
NN to outliers is lower than that of other methods. 
Using a distance metric, such as Euclidean 
distance, the K-NN algorithm locates the K- 
nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given data point. 
The majority vote or average of the K neighbors 
then controls the class or value of data points. 
Using the local structure of the data, this method 
enables the KNN algorithm to adjust to various 
patterns and generate predictions. 
The basic, non-parametric algorithm that doesn't 
make any assumptions about the distribution of 
the data is K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). This 
approach is based on the Euclidean distance 
theory, which states that examples with 
comparable characteristics tend to appear close 
together within a dataset. In the event that each 
instance has a classification tag applied, the 
closest neighbor's class can be used to determine 
the tag value of an unclassified instance. The 
current modelling entails performing every step 
thrice (repeats = 3), with a numerical value for K 
of 10 (number = 10) and averaging each of the 
three trials. 
Certainly, determining coronary artery disease 
(CAD) using the KNN is an interesting 
application of machine learning. Let’s delve into 
it: 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
Regression and classification tasks are the two 
uses for the supervised learning algorithm KNN. 
That built on the idea that the similar data points 
tend to have similar labels. KNN, a non- 
parametric method, meaning it doesn’t assume 
any kind of specific functional form for the data. 
Unlike some other algorithms, KNN memorizes 
the training set during training and performs most 
of its computation during classification. 
The key steps in KNN are: 
 
Choose a value for K. 
 
Determine 
the 
distance 
(e.g., 
Euclidean distance) between the new 
data point and all the prior data points. 
 
Select the K-nearest neighbors based 
on small distances. 
 
Assigns new data point to every class 
that appears most commonly amongst 
the K neighbor values. 
Working of KNN Algorithm: 
Given a new data point, KNN: 
1. Finds the K-nearest neighbors based on 
distance. 
2. Determines the majority class among 
those neighbors. 
3.  Gives that class ownership of the new 
data piece. 
 
The preference of K is crucial: 
o Odd values of K are preferred to 
avoid ties during voting. 
o Too small a K may lead to 
overfitting, while too large a K may 
introduce noise.

True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN), 
respectively, are symbolized by the green 
squares, and False Positive (FP) and False 
Negative (FN), on the other hand, are illustrated 
by the red squares. The sum of TP and TN gives

the sum of FP and FN gives the value of 
incorrectly     predicted     by     the     KNN. 
The correctly predicted heart diseases by the 
KNN classifier is: 
Accuracy=((38+45)/(38+10+7+45))*100 
=83% 
Therefore, the KNN algorithm has 83% 
accuracy for predicting correctly the heart 
diseases. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, 
the circumstances surrounding heart disease 
detection via AI yields promising results. Using 
the results of relevant medical data, KNN 
leverages patterns and similarities to organize 
patients 
into 
distinctive 
risk 
categories 
accurately. This is a succinct summary of how 
the KNN algorithm can be used to diagnose 
heart problems. 
The KNN algorithm serves as a key tool in heart 
disease recognition, offering a non-linear 
approach to classification based on patient data. 
By considering the proximity of data points in a 
multidimensional 
feature 
space, 
KNN 
effectively discerns patterns indicative of heart 
related risk. Through its adaptability and 
simplicity, KNN provides clinicians and 
researchers with a robust framework, aiding in 
risk 
assessment, 
early 
detection, 
and 
personalized 
treatment strategies. 
As 
AI 
continues 
to 
progress, 
integrating 
KNN 
algorithms with sophisticated medical datasets 
which holds potential in enhancing diagnostic 
accuracy, improving outcomes for patients, and 
ultimately, mitigating the cost of cardiac disease 
on global health.
