Abstract. Spam email detection is still a considerable and ongoing 
challenge in today's online environment, as the number of unsolicited emails 
keeps growing exponentially. Various algorithms such as the tree-based 
model, support vector machine Algorithm, and Convolutional Neural 
Network have been explored in prior research to tackle this challenge. This 
research specifically examines the effectiveness of the Naïve Bayes 
classifier for identifying and filtering spam emails. By delving into the 
fundamental principles of this classifier, its practical implementation, and 
the comprehensive evaluation of its performance on a combined dataset, its 
strengths and limitations in distinguishing spam from ham messages are 
revealed. The result of the study demonstrates an overall accuracy of 97.82%, 
showcasing the Naïve Bayes classifier's high efficiency and stability in 
identifying spam. With consistently high metrics score throughout both 
classes, the Naïve Bayes classifier has proven to be an exceptionally reliable 
tool for spam email detection, underscoring its suitability for numerous real-
world applications. 
1 Introduction 
With the proliferation of digital communication, email has become an essential component 
of everyday life, serving as a predominant medium for both personal and professional 
interactions. However, this surge in usage has also given rise to an equally significant 
challenge: the overwhelming prevalence of unsolicited bulk emails, commonly known as 
spam. Spam emails not only clutter inboxes, impeding the efficient communication process 
but also pose serious risks, such as exposure to malicious content and the potential for 
financial loss through phishing attacks [1, 2]. As a result, an effective spam detection 
mechanism is crucial for enhancing user experience and upholding the integrity of email 
systems. 
 Among various strategies developed to combat spam, machine-learning methods have 
proven to be effective for improving detection accuracy and efficiency [3]. Several 
algorithms have been effectively utilized for spam classification, including Support vector 
machine (SVM) [4], Genetic Decision Tree [5], particle swarm optimization [6], and deep 
learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [7]. Each of them provides 
a different level of accuracy and robustness. Within these, the Naïve Bayes classifier is 
particularly prominent due to its simplicity, efficiency, and capability to handle huge datasets

[8]. This classifier operates on the principle of conditional independence, allowing it to 
effectively categorize emails by examining the occurrence of each words related to both spam 
and ham content [9]. By leveraging historical data, the Naïve Bayes classifier can be trained 
to identify patterns that distinguish spam from ham messages, thereby automating the 
filtering process. 
 This paper focuses on applying the Naïve Bayes algorithm to identify spam emails using 
a combined dataset. By conducting a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance and 
effectiveness, this study seeks to evaluate the Naïve Bayes classifier in the context of spam 
filtering and provide insights into strategies for identifying spam. The findings are expected 
to inform future advancements in spam detection technologies, ultimately enhancing user 
experience in digital communications.  
2 Methodology 
The methodology used in this study is designed to train model for identifying spam emails 
using the Naïve Bayes approach. The methodology involves two major sections: data 
preprocessing and model training. 
2.1 Naïve Bayes Classifier 
The Naïve Bayes classifier is a family of linear statistical classifier that makes predictions 
based on Bayes' rule. Like other text classifiers, the Naïve Bayes classifier can compute a 
range of probabilities by counting the occurrence and arrangement of words in a specific 
dataset [10]. But differently, it calculates probabilities by assuming all the words are 
conditionally independent, which multiplies the likelihoods of each individual feature given 
the class label [8]. This assumption might sound unreliable since it ignored all the interactions 
between each term. In fact, it allows the classifier to easily process large datasets 
without complicated iterative parameter estimations. Surprisingly, it works well in terms of 
text classification. 
2.2 Data Preparation and Preprocessing 
To process text messages, the Naïve Bayes classifier requires a vector that captures how often 
each word appears within the emails, acting as the representation of the data. To ensure the 
vector format is suitable and unified, data preprocessing is required. The preprocessing step 
usually contains three tasks: text cleaning, tokenization and feature extraction [11]. 
1. Text Cleaning: First, to keep the data clean, all the characters that are not relative (such 
as punctuation, special characters, and HTML tags) or not contributing to the classification 
(such as stop words that carry little meaning, like "and" or "the") need to be removed. 
Additionally, all words must be converted to lowercase to ensure consistency. 
2. Tokenization: Next, the processed text is split into single words or tokens, which 
converts the data into features that the classifier can analyze, allowing it to count the 
frequency of each word. 
3. Feature Extraction: Finally, the attributes are derived from the tokens by using the Bag 
of Words (BoW) model. This model can count the frequency of each word occurring in the 
email and store it as a vector for the use of a text classifier. 
2.3 Training the Naïve Bayes Model

The Naïve Bayes classifier determines the likeliness of an email being categorized as spam 
using Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is presented below: 
𝑃𝑃(𝑐𝑐|𝑥𝑥) =
𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥|𝑐𝑐)𝑃𝑃(𝑐𝑐)
𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (1) 
In this formular, P(c|x) represents the final probability of a message to classified as spam, 
P(x|c) shows the likelihood of each word occurring in spam emails, P(c) is the prior 
probability of any particular email being spam or ham, and P(x) is the marginal probability 
of the individual words across all emails. Since the prior probabilities remain constant 
throughout classification, the resulting probability of an email's category is only affected by 
the class prior and the likelihood of each individual word.  
The prior probability of each class is determined by taking the total messages within that 
category and dividing it by the total messages in the dataset: 
  𝑃𝑃(𝑐𝑐) =
𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚  
 
 
     
 
 
     (2) 
The likelihoods of each word are calculated by tallying the frequencies of each term in 
the emails of every category. To reduce bias, the Laplace smoothing technique (adding a 
small constant) is applied to handle words that might not appear in the training data, which 
avoids zero probabilities [12]: 
𝑃𝑃(𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤|𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐) =
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐+1
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐+𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠  
 
(3) 
The total likelihood of an email’s classification is computed by multiplying the likelihood 
of each individual word in the message given to the class: 
𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥|𝑐𝑐) = ∏
𝑃𝑃(𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖|𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐)
𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=𝑛𝑛
 
 
 
 
 
 
        (4) 
Once the posterior probability is computed, the Naïve Bayes classifier will make a 
prediction by comparing the resulting probabilities of each category. The category with the 
highest resulting probability will be chosen as the predicted category for the message. 
3 Result and Discussions 
3.1. Dataset 
The primary dataset used in this study is a combined collection of spam emails sourced the 
2007 TREC Public Spam Corpus and the Enron-Spam Dataset. This collection consists of 
83,446 email entries marked as either spam ('1') or ham ('0'), as shown in Fig. 1, with 43,910 
instances of spam (52.62%) and 39,538 instances of ham (47.38%).

The dataset was split randomly into training and testing subsets with a ratio of 80% to 
20%. The training subset has a total of 66,756 emails, including 35,128 spam and 31,630 
ham, while the test subset contains 16,690 emails, with 8,782 spam and 7,908 ham. The 
overall proportions of spam and ham remain the same after the split. 
3.2. Confusion Matrix 
A confusion matrix is used to analyze the performance of the trained model on the test subset. 
It visualizes the model's effectiveness in predicting the emails’ categories by displaying the 
counts of the correctly identified spam emails (true positives, TP), the non-spam emails 
incorrectly classified as spam (false positives, FP), the correctly identified non-spam emails 
(true negatives, TN), and the spam emails that were misclassified as ham (false negatives, 
FN). 
Through the confusion matrix, four key metrics can be calculated to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the spam email detection model. As summarized in Table 1, these metrics 
include accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score [13]. Among them, accuracy indicates the 
proportion of emails correctly classified into their respective classes; recall reflects the 
model's ability to identify actual spam messages; precision measures the accuracy of emails 
predicted as spam; while the F1-score demonstrates the harmonic mean of precision and 
recall, offering a comprehensive assessment in terms of correctly detecting spam while 
reducing false positives

3.3. Model Evaluation Results 
In this research, a 5-fold cross-validation method is employed to determine the best-
performing model. This method assesses models by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets 
(folds) and testing the model's performance across various subset combinations [14]. As the 
result of the cross-validation, the accuracies for each fold are as follows: Fold 1 achieved a 
score of 0.9733, Fold 2 got 0.9766, Fold 3 got 0.9762, Fold 4 got 0.9759, and Fold 5 got 
0.9755. The average cross-validation score is approximately 0.9751, suggesting that the 
model performs stable across all subsets, with minimal variance in accuracy among the 
different data partitions. 
The model trained in Fold 2 was selected as the best-performing model for spam email 
detection. After training on the complete training dataset and evaluating it with the test subset, 
it reached a total accuracy of 97.82%. The confusion matrix values of the prediction outcomes 
are illustrated in Fig. 2.

 Among the 7,908 ham emails tested, 7,800 of them were accurately classified as ham, 
while 108 were misclassified as spam. This results in an accuracy of 98.64% for ham emails. 
For the 8,782 spam emails tested, 8,526 were accurately classified as spam, while 256 
were misclassified as ham, resulting in an accuracy of 97.08%.

These results from both ham and spam classes exhibit high precision and recall, 
demonstrating how the model could effectively distinguish between the two categories. With 
consistently high performance throughout the model, the Naïve Bayes model could be 
considered as a well-suited approach for this dataset. This emphasizes how the model is 
capable to achieve the intended outcome, making it a promising option for identifying spam 
emails. 
4 Conclusion 
In conclusion, the Naïve Bayes classifier exhibits excellent performance in differentiating 
between ham and spam emails. It emerges as a powerful tool for spam email detection, 
offering a solid foundation for upcoming research and practical uses in message filtering 
systems. Its ability to maintain high performance across diverse email types makes it 
invaluable for enhancing user experience and improving overall email management.  
 
Looking ahead, future research could explore hybrid models that combine Naïve Bayes 
with other machine learning techniques such as support vector machines or deep learning 
approaches. This could leverage the strengths of different algorithms and hopefully improve 
its accuracy. Additionally, incorporating contextual and semantic analysis may deepen the 
understanding of email content, allowing it to identify intent and relevance better. By
