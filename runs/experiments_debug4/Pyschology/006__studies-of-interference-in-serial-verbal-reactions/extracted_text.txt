STUDIES OF INTERFERENCE IN SERIAL
VERBAL REACTIONS
BY J. RIDLEY STROOP»
George Peabody College
INTRODUCTION
Interference or inhibition (the terms seem to have been
used almost indiscriminately) has been given a large place in
experimental literature. The investigation was begun by
the physiologists prior to 1890 (Bowditch and Warren, J. W.,
1890) and has been continued to the present, principally by
psychologists (Lester, 1932). Of the numerous studies that
have been published during this period only a limited number
of the most relevant reports demand our attention here.
Miinsterberg (1892) studied the inhibiting effects of
changes in common daily habits such as opening the door
of his room, dipping his pen in ink, and taking his watch out
of his pocket. He concluded that a given association can
function automatically even though some effect of a previous
contrary association remains.
Mviller and Schumann (1894) discovered that more time

was necessary to relearn a series of nonsense syllables if the
stimulus syllables had been associated with other syllables in
the meantime. From their results they deduced the law of
associative inhibition which is quoted by Kline (1921, p. 270)
as follows: "If a is already connected with b, then it is diffi-
cult to connect it with k, b gets in the way." Nonsense syl-
lables were also used by Shepard and Fogelsonger (1913) in
a series of experiments in association and inhibition. Only
three subjects were used in any experiment and the changes
introduced to produce the inhibition were so great in many
cases as to present novel situations. This latter fact was
shown by the introspections. The results showed an in-
crease in time for the response which corresponded roughly
to the increase in the complexity of the situation. The only
conclusion was stated thus: "We have found then that in
acquiring associations there is involved an inhibitory process
which is not a mere result of divided paths but has some deeper
basis yet unknown" (p. 311).
Kline (1921) used 'meaningful' material (states and
capitals, counties and county seats, and books and authors)
in a study of interference effects of associations. He found
that if the first associative bond had a recall power of 10 per-
cent or less it facilitated the second association, if it had a
recall power of 15 percent to 40 percent the inhibitory power
was small, if it had a recall power of 45 percent to 70 percent
the inhibiting strength approached a maximum, if the recall
power was 70 percent to 100 percent the inhibition was of
medium strength and in some cases might disappear or even
facilitate the learning of a new association.
In card sorting Bergstrom (1893 and 1894), Brown (1914),
Bair (1902), and Culler (1912) found that changing the
arrangement of compartments into which cards were being
sorted produced interference effects. 
Bergstrom (1894, p.
441) concluded that "the interference effect of an association
bears a constant relation to the practice effect, and is, in fact,
equivalent to it." Both Bair and Culler found that the inter-
ference of the opposing habits disappeared if the habits were
practiced alternately.

Culler (1912), in the paper already referred to, reported
two other experiments. In one experiment the subjects
associated each of a series of numbers with striking a parti-
cular key on the typewriter with a particular finger; then the
keys were changed so that four of the numbers had to be
written with fingers other than those formerly used to write
them. In the other experiment the subjects were trained to
react with the right hand to 'red' and with the left hand to
'blue.' Then the stimuli were interchanged. In the former
experiment an interference was found which decreased rapidly
with practice. In the latter experiment the interference was
overbalanced by the practice effect.
Hunter and Yarbrough (1917), Pearce (1917), and Hunter
(1922) in three closely related studies of habit interference
in the white rat in a T-shaped discrimination box found that
a previous habit interfered with the formation of an 'opposite'
habit.
Several studies have been published which were not pri-
marily studies of interference, but which employed materials
that were similar in nature to those employed in this research,
and which are concerned with why it takes more time to
name colors than to read color names. Several of these
studies have been reviewed recently by Telford (1930) and
by Ligon (1932). Only the vital point of these studies will
be mentioned here.
The difference in time for naming colors and reading color
names has been variously explained. Cattell (1886) and
Lund (1927) have attributed the difference to 'practice.'
Woodworth and Wells (1911, p. 52) have suggested that,
"The real mechanism here may very well be the mutual
interference of the five names, all of which, from immediately
preceding use, are 'on the tip of the tongue,' all are equally
ready and likely to get in one another's way." Brown (1915,
p. 51) concluded "that the difference in speed between color
naming and word reading does not depend upon practice"
but that (p. 34) "the association process in naming simple
objects like colors is radically different from the association
process in reading printed words."


--- Page 4 ---

/. RIDLEY STROOP 
]
Garrett and Lemmon (1924, p. 438) have accounted for
their findings in these words, "Hence it seems reasonable to
say that interferences which arise in naming colors are due
not so much to an equal readiness of the color names as to an
equal readiness of the color recognitive processes. Another
factor present in interference is very probably the present
strength of the associations between colors and their names,
already determined by past use." Peterson (1918 and 1925)
has attributed the difference to the fact that, "One particular
response habit has become associated with each word while
in the case of colors themselves a variety of response ten-
dencies have developed." (1925, p. 281.) As pointed out by
Telford (1930), the results published by Peterson (1925,
p. 281) and also those published by Lund (1927, p. 425)
confirm Peterson's interpretation.
Ligon (1932) has published results of a 'genetic study'
of naming colors and reading color names in which he used
638 subjects from school grades 1 to 9 inclusive. In the
light of his results he found all former explanations untenable
(He included no examination of or reference to Peterson's
data and interpretation.) and proceeded to set up a new
hypothesis based upon a three factor theory, a common factor
which he never definitely describes and special factors of
word reading and color naming. He points out that the com-
mon factor is learned but the special factors are organic. He
promises further evidence from studies now in progress.
The present problem grew out of experimental work in
color naming and word reading conducted in Jesup Psy-
chological Laboratory at George Peabody College For
Teachers. The time for reading names of colors had been
compared with the time for naming colors themselves. This
suggested a comparison of the interfering effect of color
stimuli upon reading names of colors (the two types of
stimuli being presented simultaneously) with the interfering
effect of word stimuli upon naming colors themselves. In
other words, if the word 'red' is printed in blue ink how will
the interference of the ink-color 'blue' upon reading the
printed word 'red' compare with the interference of the


--- Page 5 ---

647
printed word 'red' upon calling the name of the ink-color
'blue?' The increase in time for reacting to words caused
by the presence of conflicting color stimuli is taken as the
measure of the interference of color stimuli upon reading
words. The increase in the time for reacting to colors
caused by the presence of conflicting word stimuli is taken as
the measure of the interference of word stimuli upon naming
colors. A second problem grew out of the results of the first.
The problem was, What effect would practice in reacting to
the color stimuli in the presence of conflicting word stimuli
have upon the reaction times in the two situations described
in the first problem?
EXPERIMENTAL
The materials employed in these experiments are quite
different from any that have been used to study interference.1
In former studies the subjects were given practice in respond-
ing to a set of stimuli until associative bonds were formed
between the stimuli and the desired responses, then a change
was made in the experimental 'set up' which demanded a
different set of responses to the same set of stimuli. In the
present study pairs of conflicting stimuli, both being inherent
aspects of the same symbols, are presented simultaneously (a
name of one color printed in the ink of another color—a
word stimulus and a color stimulus). These stimuli are
varied in such a manner as to maintain the potency of their
interference effect. 
Detailed descriptions of the materials
used in each of the three experiments are included in the re-
ports of the respective experiments.
EXPERIMENT I
The Effect of Interfering Color Stimuli Upon Reading Names
of Colors Serially
Materials:
When this experiment was contemplated, the first task was to arrange suitable
tests. The colors used on the Woodworth-Wells color-sheet were considered but two
changes were deemed advisable. As the word test to be used in comparison with the
1 Descoeudres (1914) and also Goodenough and Brian (1929) presented color and
form simultaneously in studying their relative values as stimuli.

color test was to be printed in black it seemed well to substitute another color for black
as an interfering stimulus. Also, because of the difficulty of printing words in yellow
that would approximate the stimulus intensity of the other colors used, yellow was
discarded. After consulting with Dr. Peterson, black and yellow were replaced by
brown and purple. Hence, the colors used were red, blue, green, brown, and purple.
The colors were arranged so as to avoid any regularity of occurrence and so that each
color would appear twice in each column and in each row, and that no color would
immediately succeed iuelf in either column or row. The words were also arranged so
that the name of each color would appear twice in each line. No word was printed in
the color it named but an equal number of times in each of the other four colors; i.e.
the word 'red' was printed in blue, green, brown, and purple inks; the word 'blue'
was printed in red, green, brown, and purple inks; etc. No word immediately suc-
ceeded itself in either column or row. The test was printed from fourteen point
Franklin lower case type. The word arrangement was duplicated in black print
from same type. 
Each test was also printed in the reverse order which provided
a second form. The tests will be known as "Reading color names where the color of
the print and the word are different" (RCNd)* and "Reading color names printed
in black" (RCNb).
Subjects and Procedure:
Seventy college undergraduates (14 males and 56 females) were used as subjects.
Every subject read two whole sheets (the two forms) of each test at one sitting. One
half of the subjects of each sex, selected at random, read the tests in the order RCNb
(form 1), RCNd (form 2), RCNd (form 1) and RCNb (form 2), while the other half
reversed the order thus equating for practice and fatigue on each test and form. All
subjects were seated so as to have good daylight illumination from the left side only.
All subjects were in the experimental room a few minutes before beginning work to
allow the eyes to adjust to light conditions. The subjects were volunteers and appar-
ently the motivation was good.
A ten-word sample was read before the first reading of each test. The instruc-
tions were to read as quickly as possible and to leave no errors unconnected. When
an error was left the subject's attention was called to that fact as soon as the sheet
was finished. On the signal "Ready! Go!" the sheet which the subject held face
down was turned by the subject and read aloud. The words were followed on another
sheet (in black print) by the experimenter and the time was taken with a stop watch
to a fifth of a second. 
Contrary to instructions 14 subjects left a total of 24 errors
uncorrected on the RCNd test, 4 was the maximum for any subject, and 4 other sub-
jects left I error each on the RCNb test. As each subject made 200 reactions on each
test this small number of errors was considered negligible. The work was done under
good daylight illumination.
Results: Table I gives the means (m), standard deviations
(a), differences (D), probable error of the difference (PEd),
and the reliability of the difference (DJPEd) for the whole
group and for each sex.

took an average of 2.3 seconds longer to read 100 color names
printed in colors different from that named by the word
than to read the same names printed in black. This difference
is not reliable which is in agreement with Peterson's prediction
made when the test was first proposed. The means for the
sex groups show no particular difference. An examination
of the means and standard deviations for the two tests shows
that the interference factor caused a slight increase in the
variability for the whole group and for the female group, but
a slight decrease for the male group.

EXPERIMENT 2
The Effect of Interfering Word Stimuli upon
Naming Colors Serially
Materials:
For this experiment the colors of the words in the RCNd test, described in Ex-
periment I, were printed in the same order but in the form of solid squares (•) from
24 point type instead of words. This sort of problem will be referred to as the


--- Page 8 ---
650
/ . RIDLEY STROOP
"Naming color test" (NC). The RCNd test was employed also but in a very different
manner from that in Experiment 1. In this experiment the colors of the print of the
series of names were to be called in succession ignoring the colors named by the words;
e.g. where the word 'red' was printed in blue it was to be called 'blue,' where it was
printed in green it was to be called 'green,' where the word 'brown' was printed in
red it was to be called 'red,' etc. Thus color of the print was to be the controlling
stimulus and not the name of the color spelled by the word. This is to be known as
the "Naming color of word test where the color of the print and the word are different"
(NCfFd). (See Appendix B.)
Subjects and Procedure:
One hundred students (88 college undergraduates, 29 males and 59 females, and
12 graduate students, all females) served as subjects. Every subject read two whole
sheets (the two forms) of each test at one sitting. Half of the subjects read in the
order NC, NCfFd, NCfFd, NC, and the other half in the order NCfFd, NC, NC,
NCfFd, thus equating for practice and fatigue on the two tests. All subjects were
seated (in their individual tests) near the window so as to have good daylight illumi-
nation from the left side. Every subject seemed to make a real effort.
A ten-word sample of each test was read before reading the test the first time.
The instructions were to name the colors as they appeared in regular reading line as
quickly as possible and to correct all errors. The methods of starting, checking errors,
and timing were the same as those used in Experiment 1. The errors were recorded
and for each error not corrected, twice the average time per word for the reading of
the sheet on which the error was made was added to the time taken by the stop watch.
This plan of correction was arbitrary but seemed to be justified by the situation.
There were two kinds of failures to be accounted for: first, the failure to see the error:
and second, the failure to correct it. Each phase of the situation gave the subject a
time advantage which deserved taking note of. Since no accurate objective measure
was obtainable and the number of errors was small the arbitrary plan was adopted.
Fifty-nine percent of the group left an average of 2.6 errors unconnected on the NCfFd
test (200 reactions) and 32 percent of the group left an average of 1.2 errors uncor-
rected on the NC test (200 reactions). The correction changed the mean on the
NCfFd test from 108.7t0 IX°-3 a>»d the mean of the NC test from 63.0 to 63.3.
Results: The means of the times for the NC and NCWd
tests for the whole group and for each sex are presented in
Table III along with the difference, the probable error of the

difference, the reliability of the difference, and the difference
divided by the mean time for the naming color test.
The comparison of the results for the whole group on the
NC and NCWd test given in the bottom line of the table in-
dicates the strength of the inteference of the habit of calling
words upon the activity of naming colors. The mean time
for 100 responses is increased from 63.3 seconds to 110.3
seconds or an increase of 74 percent. (The medians on the
two tests are 61.9 and 110.4 seconds respectively.) The
standard deviation is increased in approximately the same
ratio from 10.8 to 18.8. The coefficient of variability remains
the same to the third decimal place {aim = .171). The
difference between means may be better evaluated when
expressed in terms of the variability of the group. The dif-
ference of 47 seconds is 2.5 standard deviation units in terms
of the NCWd test or 4.35 standard deviation units on the NC
test. The former shows that 99 percent of the group on the
NCWd test was above the mean on the NC test (took more
time); and the latter shows that the group as scored on the
NC test was well below the mean on the NCWd test. These
results are shown graphically in Fig. 1 where histograms and

show the marked interference effect of the habitual response
of calling words.

The means for the sex groups on the NCWd test show a
difference of 3.6 seconds which is only 1.16 times its probable
error; but the means on the NC test have a difference of 8.2
seconds which is 5.17 times its probable error. This reliable
sex-difference favoring the females in naming colors agrees
with the findings of Woodworth-Wells (1911), Brown (1915),
Ligon (1932), etc.
The same data are arranged according to college classi-
fication in Table IV. There is some indication of improve-

ment of the speed factor for both tests as the college rank
improves. The relative difference between the two tests,
however, remains generally the same except for fluctuations
which are probably due to the variation in the number of
cases.
EXPERIMENT 3
The Effects of Practice upon Interference
Materials:
The tests used were the same in character as those described in Experiments i
and 2 (RCNb, RCNd J?C, and NCWd) with some revision. The NC test was printed
in swastikas (M) instead of squares (•). 
Such a modification allowed white
to appear in the figure with the color, as is the case when the color is presented in the
printed word. This change also made it possible to print the NC test in shades which
more nearly match those in the NCWd test. The order of colors was determined under
one restriction other than those given in section 2. Each line contained one color
whose two appearances were separated by only one other color. This was done to
equate, as much as possible, the difficulty of the different lines of the test so that any
section of five lines would approximate the difficulty of any other section of five lines.
Two forms of the tests were printed; in one the order was the inverse of that in the
other.

Subjects and Procedure:
Thirty-two undergraduates in the University of Arizona (17 males and 15 females),
who offered their services, were the subjects. At each day's sitting 4 half-sheets of
the same test were read, and the average time (after correction was made for errors
according to the plan outlined in Experiment 2) was recorded as the day's score. Only
a few errors were left uncorrected. The largest correction made on the practice test
changed the mean from 49.3 to 49.6. The plan of experimentation was as follows:

On the 1st day the RCNb test was used to acquaint the subjects with the experimental
procedure and improve the reliability of the 2d day's test. The RCNd test was given
the id day and the 13th day to obtain a measure of the interference developed by
practice on the NC and NCWd tests. The RCNd test was given the 14th day to get
a measure of the effect of a day's practice upon the newly developed interference.
The NC test was given the 3d and 12th days, just before and just after the real practice
series, so that actual change in interference on the NCWd test might be known. The
test schedule was followed in regular daily order with two exceptions. There were
two days between test days 3 and 4, and also two between test days 8 and 9, in which
no work was done. These irregularities were occasioned by week-ends. Each sub-
ject was assigned a regular time of day for his work throughout the experiment. 
All
but two subjects followed the schedule with very little irregularity. These two were
finally dropped from the group and their data rejected.
All of the tests were given individually by the author. The subject was seated
near a window so as to have good daylight illumination from the left side. There
was no other source of light. Every subject was in the experimental room a few min-
utes before beginning work to allow his eyes to adapt to the light conditions. 
To
aid eye-adaptation and also to check for clearness of vision each subject read several
lines in a current magazine. Every subject was given Dr. Ishihara's test for color
vision. One subject was found to have some trouble with red-green color vision; and
her results were discarded though they differed from others of her sex only in the
number of errors made and corrected.
Results: The general results for the whole series of tests
are shown in Table V which presents the means, standard
deviations, and coefficients of variability for the whole group
and for each sex separately, together with a measure of sex
differences in terms of the probable error of the difference.
Table VI, which is derived from Table V, summarizes the
practice effects upon the respective tests. The graphical
representation of the results in the practice series gives the
learning curve presented in Fig. 2.

considerably by practice. Reference to Table VI shows a
gain of 16.8 seconds or 33.9 percent of the mean of the 1st

time units. The coefficient of variability is increased from
.14 ± .012 to .19 ± .015. This difference divided by its
probable error gives 2.60 which indicates that it is not reliable.
The probability of a real increase in variability, however, is
24 to 1. Hence, practice on the NCWd test serves to increase
individual differences.
An examination of the data of the sex groups reveals a
difference in speed on the NCWd test which favors the females.
This is to be expected as there is a difference in favor of
females in naming colors. Though the difference is not
reliable in any one case it exists throughout the practice
series; indicating that the relative improvement is approxi-
mately the same for the two groups. This latter fact is also
shown by the ratio of the difference between the halves of
practice series to the first half. It is .185 for the males and
.180 for the females.
The Effect of Practice on the NCWd Test upon the NC Test
The middle section of Table VI shows a gain on the NC
test of 4.0 seconds or 13.9 percent of the initial score. This
is only 23.7 percent of the gain on the NCWd test which means
that less than one fourth of the total gain on the NCWd
test is due to increase in speed in naming colors. The
improvement is greater for the males, which is accounted for
by the fact that there is more difference between naming
colors and reading names of colors for the males than for the
females.
The Effects in the RCNd Test of Practice on the
NCWd and NC Tests
The right section of Table VI shows that the practice on
the NCWd and NC tests resulted in heavy loss in speed on the
RCNd test. A comparison of the right and left sections of
the table shows that the loss on the RCNd test, when meas-
ured in absolute units, is practically equal to the gain on the
NCWd test; when measured in relative units it is much greater.
It is interesting to find that in ten short practice periods the
relative values of opposing stimuli can be modified so greatly.


--- Page 15 ---
INTERFERENCE IN SERIAL VERBAL REACTIONS. 
657
There is little relation, however, between the gain in one case
and the loss in the other. The correlation between gain and
loss in absolute units is .262 ± .11, while the correlation be-
tween percent of gain and percent of loss is .016 ± .17, or
zero. This is what one might expect.
From a consideration of the results of the two applications
of the RCNd test given in the final tests of Table V it is
evident that the newly developed interference disappears
very rapidly with practice. From one day to the next the
mean decreases from 34.8 to 22.0 seconds. This indicates
that renewing the effectiveness of old associations which are
being opposed by newly formed ones is easier than strength-
ening new associations in opposition to old well established
ones.
The variability of the group is increased by the increase
in interference due to practice on the NCWd test. The
coefficient of variability increases from .15 ± .013 to .34 ±
.031, the difference divided by its probable error being 5.65.
This is not surprising as the degree of the interference varies
widely for different subjects. Its degree is determined by
the learning on the practice series which is shown by the
individual results to vary considerably. One day's practice
on the RCNd test reduced the variability from .34 ± .031 to
.25 ± .022. The decrease in variability is 2.3 times its prob-
able error.
The data from this experiment present interesting findings
on the effect of practice upon individual differences. The
results which have already been discussed separately are
presented for comparison in Table VII.

These results show that practice increases individual
differences where a stimulus to which the subjects have an
habitual reaction pattern is interfering with reactions to a
stimulus for which the subjects do not have an habitual
reaction pattern (the word stimulus interfering with naming
colors, NCWd test); but decreases individual differences
where a stimulus to which the subjects do not have an
habitual reaction pattern is interfering with reactions to a
stimulus for which the subjects have an habitual reaction
pattern (the color stimulus interfering with reading words—
RCNd test). There are two other variables involved,
however: initial variability and length of practice. Thus in
the NCWd test the initial variability was less, the difficulty
greater, and the practice greater than in the RCNd test.
These findings lend some support to Peterson's hypothesis,
"Subjects of normal heterogeneity would become more alike
with practice on the simpler processes or activities, but more
different on the more complex activities" (Peterson and
Barlow, 1928, p. 228).
A sex difference in naming colors has been found by all
who have studied color naming and has been generally
attributed to the greater facility of women in verbal reactions
than of men. There is some indication in our data that this
sex difference may be due to the difference in the accustomed
reaction of the two sexes to colors as stimuli. In other
words responding to a color stimulus by naming the color
may be more common with females than with males. This
difference is probably built up through education. Education
in color is much more intense for girls than for boys as observ-
ing, naming, and discussing colors relative to dress is much
more common among girls than among boys. The practice in
naming colors in the NCWd test decreased the difference
between the sex groups on the NC test from a difference 5.38
times its probable error to a difference 2.99 times its probable
error. This decrease in the difference due to practice favors
the view that the difference has been acquired and is therefore
a product of training.

INTERFERENCE IN SERIAL VERBAL REACTIONS

SUMMARY
1. Interference in serial verbal reactions has been studied
by means of newly devised experimental materials. The
source of the interference is in the materials themselves.
The words red, blue, green, brown, and purple are used on the
test sheet. No word is printed in the color it names but an
equal number of times in each of the other four colors; i.e.
the word 'red' is printed in blue, green, brown, and purple
inks; the word 'blue' is printed in red, green, brown, and
purple inks; etc. Thus each word presents the name of one
color printed in ink of another color. Hence, a word stimulus
and a color stimulus both are presented simultaneously.
The words of the test are duplicated in black print and the
colors of the test are duplicated in squares or swastikas. The
difference in the time for reading the words printed in colors
and the same words printed in black is the measure of the
interference of color stimuli upon reading words. The
difference in the time for naming the colors in which the words
are printed and the same colors printed in squares (or swas-
tikas) is the measure of the interference of conflicting word
stimuli upon naming colors.
2. The interference of conflicting color stimuli upon the
time for reading 100 words (each word naming a color unlike
the ink-color of its print) caused an increase of only 2.3
seconds or 5.6 percent over the normal time for reading the
same words printed in black. This increase is not reliable.
But the interference of conflicting word stimuli upon the time
for naming 100 colors (each color being the print of a word
which names another color) caused an increase of 47.0
seconds or 74.3 percent of the normal time for naming colors
printed in squares.
These tests provide a unique basis (the interference value)
for comparing the effectiveness of the two types of associa-
tions. Since the presence of the color stimuli caused no
reliable increase over the normal time for reading words
{DjPEd = 3.64) and the presence of word stimuli caused a
considerable increase over the normal time for naming colors
(4.35 standard deviation units) the associations that have been

/. RIDLEY STROOP
formed between the word stimuli and the reading response are
evidently more effective than those that have been formed
between the color stimuli and the naming response. Since
these associations are products of training, and since the
difference in their strength corresponds roughly to the
difference in training in reading words and naming colors, it
seems reasonable to conclude that the difference in speed in
reading names of colors and in naming colors may be satis-
factorily accounted for by the difference in training in the two
activities. The word stimulus has been associated with the
specific response 'to read,' while the color stimulus has been
associated with various responses: 'to admire,' 'to name,'
'to reach for,' 'to avoid,' etc.
3. As a test of the permanency of the interference of
conflicting word stimuli to naming colors eight days practice
(200 reactions per day) were given in naming the colors of
the print of words (each word naming a color unlike the ink-
color of its print). The effects of this practice were as follows:
I. It decreased the interference of conflicting word stimuli
to naming colors but did not eliminate it. 2. It produced a
practice curve comparable to that obtained in many other
learning experiments. 3. It increased the variability of the
group. 4. It shortened the reaction time to colors presented
in color squares. 5. It increased the interference of con-
flicting color stimuli upon reading words.
4. Practice was found either to increase or to decrease
the variability of the group depending upon the nature of the
material used.
5. Some indication was found that the sex difference in
naming colors is due to the difference in the training of the
two sexes.
